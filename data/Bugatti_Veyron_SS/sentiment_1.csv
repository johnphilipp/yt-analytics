If you know about mechanics, you should know that a smaller engine with the same power is less reliable than a big engine.

Also what does the car being ugly have to do with production? I'ts been sold widely and petrolheads loves this car, do you think they love it because it's ugly ?
But well I didn't really like to talk about the beaty of something because this is a very personal subject.

Okay i'm going to do an extreme example because you don't see what I mean: Immagine a car doing a speed record with a hurricane wind of 250 mph pushing the car (winds that fast were recorded), with that wind, a car with only 50hp will be able to reach speeds of 200+ mph if it has gears long enough, does this reflect the true potential of the car ? I don't think so, because if there is no wind the car will never go to that speed.

That's why you need to complete 2 runs in opposite direction in order to achieve a speed record to avoid effects of the enventual wind pushing the car.

Maybe in the opposite direction the Venom GT will reach 260 mph or maybe 280 mph ? but the real record is the average of the both runs, it reflect the true capabilites of the car.

What I like in the Veyron is they achieved such speeds without compromising the quality and the comfort and they done 400 km/h speeds before every other manufacturer.

For me the only car that combine such quality comfort and performances like the Veyron is the Mclaren F1 the spirit of the enginers were the same but the goals were a bit different.

The Veyron was more on the luxury, easy driving car side while the Mclaren was more on the racetrack, raw sensations side.","Do you have proof that the Venom GT would be less reliable

There are plenty of vehicles that go faster than any of this lot (including rocket/jet cars and wheel driven cars)... so based upon your ""logic"", neither the Venom or the Veyron is really the fastest car. However, the criteria that Hennessey and Bugatti are making their claims for is world's fastest production car. That claim has very specific criteria which the Hennessey has not met, no matter what you may wish.

And for any land speed record, the requirement is for a run in both directions, and it has been for decades. Who knows, maybe the Venom GT would have pulled it off, but they didn't, so all they can claim is an unofficial record. By the way, the difference was roughly less than 1 mph faster than one of the two runs that the Veyron SS pulled in their attempt... 270.49 vs 269.80. Any variation in wind conditions (tailwinds) could account for that. 

I'd like to see them both run on the same track (or maybe out on the Bonneville Salt Flats or something) and see what happens and maybe we can decide this once and for all (well... and as long as Hennessey makes the required number of vehicles to be counted as a production vehicle).

They do this because if you do a top speed run with the wind pushing your car makes it faster it's like slipstreaming.

The Veyron SS top speed (431.072 km/h) was an averages of these two runs, the fastest one was about (434.30 km/h) which is about the same as the veynom GT record but was done 4 years before, that's alot in automotive industry.
Keep in mind the Veyron SS has done the record with 44hp less and about 400 more kg

Seriously. 



You could say the world's fastest car is the Hennessy Venom GT. Yes it is, but it's not the world's fastest production car. And since Hennessy didn't do the traditional two way run with the average in the end, the ended up with 435 km/h, pretty bloody quick to be honest.

The Veyron (Super Sport World Record), did two runs, first run reached around 427 km/h, second at 434 km/h, averaging at around 431 km/h. Fastest production car, having built 450 units, over the minimum limit, 30. 

Koenigseigg, our little Swedish friend, has not done top speed runs, yet, or maybe ever. The speeds you see from kids bragging are hypothesized, and not tested. Still, it does not mean that it cannot reach such speeds. 

And then we have SSC. The Ultimate Aero TT, again, has a theorised top speed. In this case, 439 km/h. They have done a run with the original aero, and accounted by Guinness, which was 412 km/h. 

TL:DR 

Veyron: Fastest Production Car {Over 30 units (450 units produced)} 
Hennessy: Fastest Car (Single Run, uncertified by Guinness) {29 units (30 unit minimum)} 
Koenigseigg: Theorised Top Speeds
SSC: Not the fastest, but improved version includes theorised top speeds. 

There you have it. Stop arguing.","Why is everyone still arguing

You could say the worlds fastest car is the Hennessy Venom GT Yes it is but its not the worlds fastest production car And since Hennessy didnt do the traditional two way run with the average in the end the ended up with 435 kmh pretty bloody quick to be honest

The Veyron Super Sport World Record did two runs first run reached around 427 kmh second at 434 kmh averaging at around 431 kmh Fastest production car having built 450 units over the minimum limit 30 

Koenigseigg our little Swedish friend has not done top speed runs yet or maybe ever The speeds you see from kids bragging are hypothesized and not tested Still it does not mean that it cannot reach such speeds 

And then we have SSC The Ultimate Aero TT again has a theorised top speed In this case 439 kmh They have done a run with the original aero and accounted by Guinness which was 412 kmh 

TLDR 

Veyron Fastest Production Car Over 30 units 450 units produced 
Hennessy Fastest Car Single Run uncertified by Guinness 29 units 30 unit minimum 
Koenigseigg Theorised Top Speeds
SSC Not the fastest but improved version includes theorised top speeds
