Prices don't mean a lot to the occasional multi millionaire/billionaire. 
Pagani's aren't about speed or times, It's like MV Agusta in the motorcycle world. It's like buying art you can use ocassionally, unlike a GTR, which is common."

40,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC,"Ill admit, this car actually stands out. The modern Lambos look like they way you'd expect. Ferraris are in the same boat. Aston Martons haven't really changed much over the years, even the Veyron looks like an R8 whos ass got too big because it ate too many chocolates. THIS is a unique design inside and out. This doesn't make you go ""Oh cool. Look at the! A (insert Supercar name here)... but this makes you go ""Holy shit what the hell is THAT!?"""
41,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx9b6JQFElBeG,Nothing wrong with Lamborghinis.

44,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx9SrFePT4kxM,@Kristen Sandaas the car looked like the Veyron albeit with slightly down on power...
45,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx9SOtTepTroc,"At least Aston Martin started making insane track cars like the Vulcans, Valkyries etc. that is simply a beauty unlike any others."

65,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx8Ul2fdaQIRq,Noah Falzarano well then the r8 is a deflated veyron

74,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx75Xtl7kqK9Z,Looks like a relaunched zonda to me... :/
75,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx75AkjO2gDxw,@jkflipflop98¬†The fun thing about that is that the VandeGraaffgenerator is actually invented by my ancestors. There are many van de Graaff families in Holland but my ancestor invented it.
76,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx7595QtpAYhm,@kristenburnout1 I imagine a car going down the street flinging lightening bolts at parked vehicles and pedestrians.

My backname is Carl Johannes Messemaeckers van de Graaff, doesn't even fit on the school list. It's always written like this: Carl Johannes Messemae and then it stops because there is no room.

79,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx70N8Ecq2cqT,"I was just thinking, At least a third of what sells a car of THESE statures, at least, is the name. Pagani, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Saleen, Shelby....so forth and so on, are named after real people. Names that can actually roll of your tongue. You'll never see a car named ""The Andrew"" or ""The Samantha""....."
80,UgjE5Qn3I3cSGXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-PsFx70L6fRACxTu,I totally agree with that lol

82,UgyAcYaEBcyQsUVB1YN4AaABAg,Can't believe this review was 7 years ago. I've watched it a couple of times when it was released. Still one of the best hypercars imo.

98,UgzJyME0qA76FGNnkuh4AaABAg,I have the utmost respect for such delicate craftsmanship. The details are absolutely mental.
99,Ugi_uH8ATeUgongCoAEC,this is my all time favorite car. the expression on Richards face explains just how awesome this vehicle is. Horacio Pagani is a genius
100,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC,"This thing is a century ahead of Veyron when it comes to styling, attention to detail, interior design and just overal package. Veyron or chiron maybe faster but both of those have sex appeal of a vw Beatle while Pagani is as good as it gets."
101,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S9RsHqoAivMv,"@Liam Ott I mean, I‚Äôd argue the most of the chicks in a beetle have been hit over the head with a crowbar."

107,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8wk31cK1PHh,you would be surprised how much of a chick magnet the beetle is.
108,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8uyH3ThVhAL,"Definitely going to disagree, Veyron literally invented one of the most iconic looks, that doesn't just get handed to you...you create it."

111,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8ldkZc_nnwc,"Disagreed. You're comparing apples to bananas. Vayron and Chiron have a very different market. Their purpose is to go fast and do it with ease and comfort. And I dont know what you're smoking... Yes, the Vayron looks a bit dated and bulbous, but the Chiron is timeless. It will still look great in 30-50 years."
112,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8OsM-QWm5mk,"Jasko CR Dude.... it's idiotic to compare those cars... the veyron and the Chiron are cars that were made with a completely different purpose. With Veyron and the Chiron, the purpose was to see where the limits are, not to build a Sexy car or a race car. If you want a sexy, beautyful car, get an alfa romeo, if you like rali racing, you get a mitsubishi or subaru and so on... you can't compare every car with each other."
113,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8MrvNbBxk7X,Jasko CR besides you cannot drive veyron everyday it cost a lot and it's maintenance is sky high
114,UggknTk6qahr4HgCoAEC.8JL73PLIo1S8Lz476v32W5,I agree. Horazzio has made a machine which will never die even after 200 years ‚ô•

If you pay attention to what Hammond says about the design of this Huayra, it looks like a victorian‚Äôs idea of the 23rd century. It is a completely different idea to the mainstream idea of where cars and the future is headed. The Huayra is like beholding one of those abstract paintings in an art gallery.

260,Ugz6Fnm-gwP0T3-i8kd4AaABAg,Automotive art form. This car will go down as one of the most beautiful cars in the 21st century
261,Ugha3tlOvthl-XgCoAEC,I think that the Huayra is the most beautifully appointed car that has ever been crafted.
262,UgjaYFjVPGlWQngCoAEC,Those flaps are amazing. I would probably crash just trying to watch them deploy. Lol

269,UgjaYFjVPGlWQngCoAEC.8FjMheKk3LV8GHfzHNUh_7,Part of me wishes you can deploy them on purpose. They'd be an even better toy than pop-up headlights.

286,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc9DTjdNnXSm8,"Obi wan kenobi - That Ferrari has changed they way to publish car models is true. They probably made more cars in the last 15 years then the previous 30.
But when they make the special brand new super car they make school to the rest of the world. The same does Lamborghini, more or less. Ferrari was always the first to make some special details as the function on the wheel similar to the Ferrari Formula One car now everyone puts buttons everywhere. If you look the back of the Pagani Huayra, it‚Äôs an Enzo inspired (lights). The air flow holes for the aereo dynamic, the steering wheel gear etc etc.. all things only Ferrari has put out first. Now it‚Äôs granted and everyone does it but who always has the ideas and talent ?"
287,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc9DROrKjn42W,"Obi wan kenobi - I don‚Äôt care about a boring world top speed record on a 4 mile long straight track without any curves and slope to be honest. Where‚Äôs the passion for a motorsport ? There isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs pure obsession and neediness. In the USA they build ‚Äúcars‚Äù (they call it so) that reach 1.000 KM/h. In fact they‚Äôre rockets in any üöÄ sense. They do this top speed tests in the desert but they‚Äôve just the goal to reach a certain speed. It has nothing to do with Motorsport. It‚Äôs an obsession. And as far as you‚Äôre passionate about Motorsport you still watch it. But it goes behind that. Don‚Äôt think other carmakers as FERRARI or Lamborghini etc cannot build a car that reaches 500 Km/h. They just don‚Äôt want to. They don‚Äôt need to. They would ruin their solid image with this needy propaganda. Bugatti needed some talking about them after the acquisition of VW Group. So they needed to make something very fast, luxurious and expensive. But how does it drives in a circuit ? I get more excitement with my MINI Cooper S in curves mate. But let‚Äôs be honest, the Veyron and Chiron are at lest nice looking, that absolutely true. But don‚Äôt justify the change of 4 tyres at a cost of a half Maserati."
288,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc9CJU91aZ1y6,"In my opinion Koenigsegg is the most overrated instead. They wouldn‚Äôt exist if it wouldn‚Äôt be for Ferrari or Lamborghini who inspired them. Nowadays carmaker as Koenigsegg and Bugatti in particularly are only interested in making it look expensive and luxurious. And just release it as the most fastest car on the planed. A Bugatti Chiron cost more the 3 time then an AVENTADOR, but with an AVENTADOR you have more fun to drive, better sound and looks dozen of times better then an ugly Koenigsegg. Just overrated they are."

303,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc8mkwFvDd15L,Koenigsegg in 2018 is overrated.
304,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc8ldjf3O3nsY,And you wonder why.... I dont talk a lot about Koenigseggs and paganis because they will always be out of reach of anyone who isnt a billionaire. Porsches and Ferraris can actually be purchased by someone who still has to work for a living if they want it bad enough.

But no car in the world is a special as a Pagani (imho). Don't get why so many people hate them."
314,UggJXKF-Ad71T3gCoAEC.89UYVoR8sDc8DN1c5l3Ysi,"+Devansh Gupta Christian and Horacio are in the opposite spectrums. Christian  cares about specs no matter what, his cars are singular in their purpose to be the ultimate cars. Horacio cares only for the aesthetic value, the details, and the drama, traits that the Paganis all have in spades. There's little point in comparing the 2 because they ultimately are trying 2 entirely different approaches to hypercar making. They both deserve acclaim equally."

427,UggenlDDbIlkRHgCoAEC,"Thank god this car's in gta 5! I bloody love it, it make my Aston Martians look like toy cars. Here I thought Zonda couldn't get any better. Usually for me cars don't in my opinion. Like the dodge viper for instance; the 99' version is my all time favorite. It was the first car that I ever really got into, and is the reason I got into cars. Unfortunately, as the years passed on, I've hadn't had the interest of what car makers were developing. I love a good ol classic car, like one of the greatest british cars ever developed; the jaguar E type. Come on, if your a Brit who loves cars as much as I do, you can't help but love the car. It's like ice cream, who the bloody hell hates ice cream? Europe has the best cars that were made for those who wanted to start a collection or just simply like me; to admire and apreshiate the beauty of the car dealership. Because Europe is beauty and people should apreshiate it's wonderful indulgents. Just wish the bloody euro want goin to hell tho..."
428,UghWfteNtVkWvXgCoAEC,hammond is such a good driver iv seen him save two many times that noble save in monza is just epic

432,UgzAVMFOIA7qGKzZDTB4AaABAg,"Been a long time, and the Huayra has really grown on me. Especially Koshbin's Hermes Huayra. 

I think Mercedes F1 dominance has also played it's role in that. Back in the day I was sleeping on AMG. Now I'm slightly less stupid."
433,UgzRElCLPLTk5UTPn5p4AaABAg,That is the most beautiful interior I‚Äôve ever seen on a modern car.
434,UgzLbaV5F1gLq-z0tlN4AaABAg,This is so much much more iconic than the dated zonda was. I think this should be seen as Pagani's '1st' proper car. It's amazing.
435,Uggn8DwGiCrJdngCoAEC,"The only thing I really miss on this car is the insane Zonda engine scream. Apart from that, it's amazing."

437,Ugx16pWtStO0dBSADFV4AaABAg,One of the most beautiful supercar ever created. The Pagani Huayra looks like a jet fighter on wheel. The gauge cluster is wonderful.

441,UgxkAFLC_X2PbYAehkV4AaABAg,I've watching this like 10 times already at least and still can't get enough of it
442,UggHy79PuALzQHgCoAEC,This car is absolutely gorgeous. ¬†I love every little bit about it. ¬†I think Richard Hammond has hit the nail on the head when describing this car.
443,Ugxq9iDkOEX2I4NxPWt4AaABAg,It's simply the best car ever made!
444,UgjgK_uYNoXTzXgCoAEC,Imagine if pagani made their own hybrid hypercar! That would be a seriously epic car!
445,Ugw8XSWqqwxso4N3xCV4AaABAg,Hammond going on about the gears is why I love this show...
446,UgwSRoTqBvIm6gQt6c94AaABAg,I love that the Huayra looks like a natural evolution of the Zonda‚Äôs DNA but also is distinct enough from the Zonda that you could tell them apart fairly easily.
447,UgiIn_YkpdYPvHgCoAEC,I love Pagani and every car they've made. I totally agree with Hammond about Lambo and Ferrari.
448,UgyN-JxiUZrh63i3pmt4AaABAg,It‚Äôs like the interior looks like the time machine üòÇüëåü§©üëç
449,Ugwfk8yLzIoBGqxLbuV4AaABAg,"There was something in the editing or however all of the music, the drone shots, and everything else came together that they ALL (TGT and new TG) lost after these 3 went to Amazon. The final shots are gorgeous and the last minute or so of this film could've been the end of a blockbuster movie. The last 5 years of O.G Top Gear produced some of the highest quality reviews ever made, and it wont ever be replicated."
450,UghAo-G4XZ0Ld3gCoAEC,"Who would have this masterpiece over a McLaren P1 and La Ferrari? I would.
I agree with Richard , there is something truly special about this ""supercar""."
451,UgwO5oJJgen2EFTaNnR4AaABAg,The Pagani Huarya looks so timeless! I may not sound good as Zonda but I'll take It anyday!
452,Ugzi0Mr94rfdUkmbwVJ4AaABAg,Huayra is simply the best supercar built in this century.
453,Ugx4A1_h80KWVACxi3B4AaABAg,"I love the pagani Zonda and the huarya, because they‚Äôre just beautiful cars"
454,Ugh_cIjXO2pvXngCoAEC,this is the type of car I wouldnt mind not having a manual shifter and clutch pedal
455,UgzMfKgGTnM8mpR7Ikd4AaABAg,Pagani an artist and science collide together to create the most awesome artistic supercar. A true car is a piece of art but a superb machine not just any car a true gallery artwork inside and out with the machinery mastery! üòÅüëç
456,Ugi25v_KjzteQ3gCoAEC,"This interior makes me think of Bioshock Infinite for some reason ... If I could afford such a car I would definitely get a Pagani, I feel like it stands out in so many way. Like he explained in this video. Living in L.A. and Paris I've seen so many Ferraris and Lambos, but haven't seen a Pagani, I feel like it's a car for people who actually looks for something exclusive, yet extremely detailed and on top of the line performance wise!!!"
457,UgwoGtPTT0Q8mq5h4dp4AaABAg,Pagani Hyuara is truly a mind blowing supercar. Different to any car other car in the world.
458,UgwWh-DzXP9E4h6r7mN4AaABAg,"Al principio lo encontraba feo, pero tiene algo que luego te enamora, algo que las otras marcas no tienen."

462,UgwjljdQBY9SybNmOot4AaABAg,"I like how he said that the 2004 Pagani Zonda went 0-60 in 3 seconds, but that the Huayra goes 0-60 in 3.2 seconds"
463,UgwBH8qS9K-evLsDoel4AaABAg,The car is so beautiful it gave me goosebumps
464,UggelT0s1APYgXgCoAEC,as much as i love what this movie does for the huayra i still can't get past the zonda. goodbye Pagani Zonda R best driver's car ever made.
465,UghzFalN4UfY1XgCoAEC,This car has one the sexiest interiors I've seen
466,UgwMS3JKU3GZZq03vPZ4AaABAg,"When it comes to the more serious montage's, Hammond makes the best, and the Huayra was even better than that."
467,UgxJ46EJjWBgvigkvlh4AaABAg,With Hammond in it the Car looks so spacious! But from experience I can tell that‚Äôs not the case
468,UgzBn72rdvoWeOyUFcJ4AaABAg,These are the reviews I miss that these guys did on this show.
469,UgxlU2TjgZDpfXqu0j94AaABAg,"I wish Pagani would make an SUV i.e. an everyday car with 5 seats, high seating position and good luggage space.  An SUV with that level of attention to detail,  would be fantastic."

477,Ugj5eq23j4Jo-ngCoAEC,The Zonda was such a striking looking supercar that this Huayra pales in comparison. The interior on the Huayra is top notch though.
478,Ugj5eq23j4Jo-ngCoAEC.8Lk_VpD18Rm8O25AbsAFRb,doritos with mountain dew I never said anything about the driving experience did I?
479,Ugj5eq23j4Jo-ngCoAEC.8Lk_VpD18Rm8O2-GtdEFRY,SpyderRios Honestly that seems like the perspective from a non-petrolhead. It is supposed to capture that moment when a plane takes off. That's why in the inside there is a ton of turbo noise and that's why there are flaps on the front and the back. And when you see that you see the beauty of this car. And that's when you prefer it over the Zonda
480,Ugj5eq23j4Jo-ngCoAEC.8Lk_VpD18Rm8MrvgP2ZCKc,SpyderRios the zonda have edgy style while the huayra have curves. The zonda was sexy but the huayra is majestic

But with Pagani, it feels like supercars that would've existed 30 years ago, but by now are gone, are in fact still around.  An innocent, modern supercar maker that brings a taste of the old supercar age and feel back to the 21st century."

735,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8Sd4aTv0yd4,"Randy Butternubs Yep. In just 10 years, Pagani has become almost the go to for supercar/hypercar elegance. Nothing really spells class on the road like a pagani. And Koenigsegg is THE KING of hypercars and speed. Look at the Agera R, One:1 and Regera. These three cars wipe the road with anything else that dares challenge them."
736,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8Lz4NVk0GRn,Yes. The Huayra and the Koenigsegg are cool
737,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8L1pjS85Bbv,"@TheFede8888 I'm not sure what you mean... McLaren has 3 models and variants of those models. Ferrari has the California, 488, FF, F12, and LaFerrari along with different variants of those models. That's quite a few more models than McLaren. I do agree that McLaren is more similar to Ferrari in mission than to Pagani or Keonigsegg. Those companies are more concerned with producing limited edition ultra exotics rather than mass producing supercars that have racing pedigree."
738,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8KzZ_F6qLk8,+BYSMA4th McLaren do the same thing with their cars...same design with same power engine...pagani is actually a small company...Mclaren is a multinational...like a Ferrari...different territory...

740,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8Jc2Fw_skcK,Pagani is a privately owned company and makes cars with immense attention to details and Ferrari and Lamborghini like Richard said are owned by fiat and Audi and these companies are basically using Lamborghini and Ferrari to make all the money in the world
741,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8J_aD5qAYo2,"348 was the last model that Enzo oversaw, he just wasnt there to see it through to the end. Remember these cars are developed years before they hit the road."
742,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JLE6CavQUH,"@BYSMA4th I think they going in both direction. They make mass produce ferraris and ones that are limited, like ezno and laferrari."
743,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JLDg6_9y67,"@Jasko CR Ferrari used to be a lot more narrow in terms of the number of models they produced, but as popularity in China and the Middle East grew they had to expand their brand. I don't criticize Ferrari for making those business decisions, but it has robbed Ferrari of that narrow focus that smaller companies can have."
744,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JL7oVdKWb6,I meant 1000 times more**
745,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JL7hV4IJXY,"Yeah but while Pagani and Koenigsegg produce limited number of cars and have one model production, Ferrari has so many and makes 1000 more cars a year. If Ferrari had one model to work on year around the story would be different."
746,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JGVKWICHSv,"Koenigsegg is actually making intuitive things that could have been made years ago (electric camshaft motors, 2-4 stroke switching, more effective cylinder deactivation) Ferrari is in the past now, they may have helped shape what performance cars have become but they are incredibly if not completely irrelevant at this point (with an exception of Formula 1)"
747,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JFIDk2wGTG,"@BYSMA4th I dont think that Ferrari Enzo and LaFerrari are ""same type"" of anything.."
748,UghnQKn-Hz6GHHgCoAEC.8DSytaZZSDL8JF0qppdEWU,"Ferrari was right there 50 years ago doing what Pagani and Koenigsegg are doing today. Unfortunately I think the company's vision was taken to the grave with Mr. Ferrari, and thus people look at the F40 (the last car Enzo Ferrari personally oversaw in the company) as the company's best achievement. 

Since then I think Ferrari has become too routine, they produce the same type of car over and over...I mean, the 360, 430, 458, and 488 are just incrementally better versions of one another, same with the 575, 599 and F12, and the 456, 612 and FF.

I think these new companies like Pagani, Koenigsegg, and Mclaren are taking the helm of the supercar. Ferrari and Lamborghini are still given royalty status, but I think that's exactly what makes the new companies cool. They have something to prove, so they are giving us really special cars."

If you slap a car onto a dyno, that's what number you get.  Crank horsepower is the horsepower that the engine puts out, which only 85% or so of which actually gets to the wheels.  This is called drivetrain loss."

771,Ugg28aaeya9EcHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-25_M70YjRzZYiqs,@Lucas Caetano¬†So BHP isn't actually the power the car is using. HP is the power of the car after things like friction reduce it?

However if I had to pick between the two Paganis (the Zonda or the Huayra) I'd go with this.

The Zonda is an astonishing hypercar, but the Huayra is just so utterly and deliciously nerdy and insane.

If I ever owned one of those, I would re work the entire interior. It ruins the car for me personally. For me, I like super cars like the Mclaren F1, the Lamborghini Diablo, and Countach, the Ferrari 550 Maranello. The ones that aren't very fancy, ones that are bare bones and leave the driving up to the driver. The Noble M600, the Koenigsegg Agera R... those are super cars I want to see more of. All of this technology, stupidly complex and hi-tech jazz is taking over what are supposed to be driving machines... Some people like that.

1300,Ugg-RFcpR7JZ-HgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-1J5e75QxxDaHfCv,"@Creed Killa I agree with what you have been saying, but German engineering got most of its reputation from its historic cars rather than its modern ones, pretty much all modern cars are utterly awful with regards to longevity and durability. Car manufacturers realised somewhere around the 90's that they don't make money from second hand car sales but they do make money from charging customers for replacement parts... See ? an unreliable shit box suites car companies just fine. That being said older Mercedes were built like tanks and lets not forget the humble VW beetle and its earlier family tree, you cannot put a bad word against them when it comes to engineering quality."
1301,Ugg-RFcpR7JZ-HgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-1J5e75LJGmYNQrR,"@Jo√£o Matos¬†The more complex you make a machine, the more likely it is for one of the parts to fail.

1303,Ugg-RFcpR7JZ-HgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-1J5e75InkJz5KF_,"@Jo√£o Matos¬†Agreed, electronic software and mechanical hardware should be kept separate in cars for the most part (or at least in major components such as the transmission or the engine). Unless obviously it is a hybrid or all electric vehicle. Advancement is good, but not beneficial if it is driving purchase and maintenance prices for cars out of the reach of normal people.¬†"

1449,UgztHrmIsL-nMY2pQ7x4AaABAg,"With a different eye with the same esthetic over all look .A stripped down version of this car .such as 24hrs for name badge.5 days for a wheel.such things are bragging rights not necessities. Par down the over the topness but still with the design feel of the Victorians version of a future super car. Intact.
It would lower the cost ,gain weight savings, perhaps be even a better car ( a sports car version of this luxury version) that would be a more desirable car for me.
This car is like a very over the top wrist watch .I do LOVE. The ""series of unfortunate events "" look and feel of the car with out the over the top. Gizmo. Watch thing its got going on .Would be far more to my tastes. A wider appealing car to set in the car collection.Its not guady but its over the top like the designer didnt know when to show restraint. You cant help but love the talent in all the cars elements .
It is just completely over the top ( executed with the highest design , rest assured) but a super car ,even hyper car ,must remember
Its still a sports car at its heart."

The 230 mph is just to hold off critics that would compare it to cars like the noble or the laferrari, 918 and p1 hybrid trio. But if you're buying a huayra, you're doing it for the insane track days (in the corners, acceleration and just ergonomics, not only top speed), the looks you get from EVERYBODY, even people who don't like cars, and the pride of knowing you own one of the finest pieces of engineering on 4 wheels that's built with no compromise.

Apparently replies seem to be disabled to your comment so I am not allowed to reply your original comment for some reason or another, so here is my response:
Clearly you do not know what a ""facelift is"", one of the more vague definitions of a facelift is: ""a procedure carried out to improve the appearance of something"". Thus the Pagani Huayra clearly isn't a facelift, since it has been engineered from the ground up as a new car, the bodywork is completely different, the mechanics, the software, the aero, the interior and so forth is vastly different. Should I keep going? Even Pagani has said that the Huayra is not a new Zonda, it is not a replacement nor is it supposed to be compared to the Zonda - it is a completely different beast and as such it is definitely not a ""facelift"", no matter how much you argue, think it appears or wants it to be.¬†"

1750,UghIr9NxPNnwoHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-BNKr71yDcvX_eBx,"I see what you're saying...when you look at Mclaren and Koenigsegg, who use twin-turbos on V8s (at 3.8 and 5 litres respectively), their power outputs are incredible, especially Koenigsegg's. The Mcl 650s produces 641hp from the 3.8 V8. I can't help wondering what they'd get out of an engine the size of the Huayra's...? However, one important thing to note is that the Huayra is monstrously torquey: the 650s will give you 680nM for a kerb weight of 1,428kg, whereas the Huayra delivers 1,000nM for its kerb weight of 1,350kg. The initial acceleration must rip your face off. Having said all that, I'd rather have a P1, which apart from my preference for its looks, seems to accelerate much faster up to 200mph than the Huayra (though the Huayra has a higher VM), and would presumably cost quite a bit less to run (using that same 3.8 V8 as the 650s, plus the electric element).

It doesn't shout as much as before due to the fact that there are some noise limits. When Jeremy interviewed the Zonda R, he mentioned that there are such things, and that if you want to buy a track - that does get you in trouble if your car is too noisy - is about 6 billion pounds.

This is a road car. It gives you speed, handling, beauty and responsibility. If you don't use that responsibility, you're just going to end up violating all the laws. 

So, Pagani made sure you can at least drive it around without getting busted for some ""big noise"" nonsense."

1987,UgjhyIis8b-uk3gCoAEC,"The Zonda is a great supercar, but it's pretty lame that they never made a car that doesn't have cool door styles and better luxury. Since the Huayra came out, I've liked the gull-wing doors and amazing luxury. And it has been the fastest Pagani supercar. So I like the Huayra much better."
1988,UgjhyIis8b-uk3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-1K6e7-OjfihCOyZ,"No, the Zonda isn't the fastest, the Huayra is
222 mph but the Zonda is 215, and the Zonda R is 218, but I think the Zonda S , the new
released Zonda is the fastest with a top speed of 219 mph"
1989,UgjhyIis8b-uk3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-1K6e7-IhXdaQ8mS,"The Pagani Zonda Absolute is the fastest Pagani I believe actually, It's a Zonda 760 with the engine from a Cinque."

1991,UgieOWqzd2KMRXgCoAEC,"The First EVER Car to come out of LATIN AMERICA is this Beast called Huayra.
Thats so effin cool!"
1992,UghnmlX0GXcCKHgCoAEC,Pagani Automobili was born to become a legend. The Zonda and the Huayra are the links between generations of cars. Zonda led to the Hypercar (later went on to become one). The Huayra led to the Megacar. Hopefully the Huayra Cinque or something will became a megacar in the future. Come on Pagani! Make a Huayra R!
1993,UghnmlX0GXcCKHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-9qq47-xGmMFxoBA,"Oh....My.....God.....Huayra R... PAGANI DAMNIT I WILL BE A WANTED CRIMINAL TO PAY FOR IT.... and I shall run from all the cops...Then drive to Italy, where Italian cops will be forced to not harm the car in anyway...¬†"
1994,Ugi_Y3MTm1W6ZXgCoAEC,Customers still want the Zonda though. Lewis Hamilton and that man from chile bought got Zonda 760's. The Huayra is great. But there's just something about the special edition hardcore zonda's. 
1995,UghhotulLUwoV3gCoAEC,"I'd rather save myself half a million pounds and get an Aventador...... Regardless of who owns the company that is still a proper lambo, plus it's faster and looks better on a poster"

2018,UggPOUuLFWY7S3gCoAEC,"It would be even MORE special if ""Pagani"" produced their own engines (I love this car and the AMG customed power-plant)...and outsourced the power-plant to ""Mercedes AMG Group"", (I think they're tops in research/development/The AMG sector) but think about that for a sec... If Ferrari's were running off BMW powered engine, would it be just as special? That's when ""Pagani"" would stamp it's mark in the world of one of the top hyper auto manufacturers.

I can also drop one of those motors on a bike (1/3 of the weight of the ""Pagani""), a motorbike with a sidecar and smoke a ""Pagani"", does that make it special with a history of it's pedigree?¬†

Going by that route, I'd still take a ""McLaren F1 GTR"" powered by ""BMW"" almost two decades old. Yes! less H.P. and you are risking your life by taking it to the extreme (without safety features) but it's naturally aspirated, nearly as fast straight-line speed with higher top speed!...2O YEARS AGO! ""Curb weights LESS than¬†1,138‚Äì1,062 kg (2,509‚Äì2,341 lb)"". Two decades old! And it seats three, two pairs of sexy legs, side-by-each of you."

2165,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE71vuxq3_2R7,@Svere Style The Pagani is one of the nicest and highest quality cars ever made. The vette is basically a massive engine in a plastic box probably the worst supercar in production at the moment I hesitate to even call it a supercar.
2166,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE71jw7uuP1gx,Are you really trying to compare the plastic box that is a Corvette to an masterpiece that is a Pagani ??
2167,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE71TYg9oTf8s,"@Svere Style Huayra's handling is mildly better than Corvette's. Not to mention the fact that the Corvettes tend to break down if you push them too oftenly. Which means it can't be worth the money. 

This monstrosity, however, is worth it. Better engineering, better handling, higher top speed, better brakes. Don't overlook all of that."

2169,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE71K82_6fzzH,"@Svere Style  There have been tests of the huayra and more recent models are tweaked and improved. theres a record of 2.79 seconds 0-60 for the huayra on the internet. My point is, the corvette may be a great car, but with the huayra you're paying for the handbuilt craftsmenship and exquisite styling, aswell as its extreme performance. it is more expensive for a reason ( same story with the GTR etc) you dont dream of having a quick nissan, you dream of having a howling lamborghini or ferocious pagani, hence the pricetag."
2170,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE70Me04x9hR1,who needs a 230 mph top speed when its almost impossible for you to reach it? there is very few places in the world that you can achieve that topspeed.
2171,UgjWLTS7wjVeTngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-E2kE7-vVk-ZWXGJ,In the long run the pagani would take the Z06 any day.

Look at the Lotus Evora. It has the V6 from a Camry (hardly sportscar material). Or the reversed situation. The Shelby Mustang GT500, great engine, shit suspension.

I'd much rather have the Evora."
2391,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW70516x7ab15,"@MrFalconfly The M120 V12 AMG is the engine used in different iterations in all of the Zondas that we have seen. The Zonda C12, C12S, F (Fangio), R, 760RS, Revolucion, all have the M120 AMG engine. Now lets take a look at where the M120 was used in Mercedes Benz production vehicles, regular, and AMG... the R129 SL73 AMG¬† M120 is almost identical to that engine of the Zonda C12S with a few upgrades to be more durable and race ready. The W140 S class used the M120 as well (S600), and so on. The M120 is NOT a bespoke engine. Search and read.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Huayra has the M158 AMG V12 in it, said to be a uniquely built (""bespoke"") engine for the Huayra, but yet was utilized in the SL65 AMG Black Series in a different iteration with the same displacement. I am NOT saying that a Mercedes AMG vehicle is the same as Pagani. What I am saying is that Pagani is using the engines from Mercedes Benz AMG by choice because of their supreme Combustion Motorsport ingenuity. Then he puts it in his own designed car which is perfect, to create the perfect race care hyper car whatever car you want to call it.¬†As well as because Juan Manuel Fangio was a Mercedes F1 driver,¬†who was also¬†a dear friend of Horacio Pagani, who won races¬†year after year because of their supreme engineering. Search and read.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Where you only stand correct is that the car's character is based upon chassis, breaks, suspension, transmission, exhaust, that is where you are correct. But I am speaking strictly on terms of engine reliability that supports extreme power. No Lamborghini, Audi, McLaren, BMW, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Lotus, you name it, can have 1.1 million kilometers as proven that Pagani is able to reach in the 760 nonno test car¬†Zonda which was driven by David Testi , and still be reliable, in fact still even exist and run like a champ¬†like that specific Pagani stands. No other hypercar on earth has that¬†number¬†on the¬†odometer¬†and where the engine is still ticking alive.¬†No for real, search and read
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Search the Mercedes Sauber #63¬†C9 which utilized the M119 5.6 liter V8 twin turbo back in the 90s in Le Mans series. The car had a top speed of 250mph, and had statistics that leave Bugatti scratching their heads today. The M119 was used in production cars in different iterations(SEL, SL)¬†just as they do with engines today in their line up.¬†Also search the 21.5 liter 4 cylinder engine Mercedes built in 1909 which had a top speed of 140mph, where airplanes were just barely flying at 70-80 mph. There is a history of Supreme engineering in motorsport behind Mercedes Benz and in Motors in general.¬†If somebody doesn't recognize that, then you have not done your reading/ driving, and this ultimate supreme engineering is why Horacio Pagani uses a hand built Mercedes Benz AMG engine in his masterpiece Pagani Automobili Modena. Without the AMG engine, the Pagani would never, ever be the hypercar that we all love and see today and in the recent past. It would look like it, but would not have the same Mechanical heart and characteristic.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† And my friends, hate it or love it, this is why the Mercedes Benz AMG engine is utilized in all Paganis of the past, the present, and the future... because simply nobody can match the performance, lifespan, and reliability of a combustion motor¬†all in relativity to each other, like Mercedes Benz AMG.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I write this in depth to make it clear that your statements of Proprietary and Bespoke, as well as ""it is not the engine that makes the car""¬†are false,¬†and in fact very primitive because they do not match the facts that exist.
Mercedes Benz AMG +¬†¬†Pagani Automobili Modena = perfect depiction of Leonardo Da Vinci's notion that Art and Science can walk hand in hand, and with these two variable as examples, we see it first hand. This Man Mr. Horacio Pagani thought long and hard and chose wisely which is why Pagani is here where it stands today. Cheers all and good luck in life.

Proprietary. Bespoke.

Sure it might be built by AMG (or BMW in McLaren's case) but it's built to specification of the company (Pagani or McLaren) who need it.

If it wasn't AMG then it'd be a BMW M engine in the Huayra.

Just get over that not all companies use in house engines (especially not low-output ones like Pagani)."
2393,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-w_9omV3Ks,"Because an entire engine is on a different scale than brakes. Same as with the McLaren F1, the engine was completely designed and built by BMW. And then there's Gordon Murray taking all the credit to himself."
2394,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-wYv1kD8Yb,"@thatabu
And just like McLaren was (back in the GM and BMW engine times) Pagani isn't a high volume large manufacturer.

They need to specialize in what they do best (awesome designs, great handling, hyper advanced carbon composites) and let other people do some of the other jobs (AMG engine, Brembo Brakes, MHG Group exhausts who btw also make exhausts for F1 racers).

Also, why are people miffed at Pagani for using a bespoke AMG engine, but not at Ferrari for using Brembo brakes?"
2395,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-wVBM8BWYk,I know but all of those manufacturers apart from McLaren are owned by other companies. ¬† As far as I know Pagani isn't owned by Mercedes.
2396,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-wRbFodUNu,"@thatabu
Current Lamborghini's use Audi tech in their engines (including the V12 in the Aventador).

And a lot of high class marques use engines or at least engines based off of other companies.

Aston Martin use V12s based on the V6 Ford Mondeo engine, Range Rover use Jaguar V8s, Zenvo based their engine block off the dimensions of the LSX from GM, and Rolls Royce use BMW tech extensively. Hell even McLaren used both GM and BMW engines in their past.

I couldn't care less what badge might be on the engine. As long as it does the job of providing power (and a reasonable soundtrack)."
2397,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-wPaUsvQ_9,"@MrFalconfly¬†Still, the engine is the heart of the car. Any car manufacturer that is serious about their cars should develop their own engines. Lamborghini have been developing and building their V12s on their own way before Audi bought the company."
2398,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-mBBUVacJH,"Lotus still use Toyota engines. And Lamborghini uses Audi R&D when they build new engines.

It isn't the engine that makes a car great (far from it). That's just some Yank excuse for making HUGE 8.4l V10 engines. It's the chassis, suspension and brakes that make the car great. And when it comes to finesse, handling and lunacy there's none greater than Pagani."
2399,UgjSj4mHLu_4a3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-S7MW7-lEcWTLcEK,"Mercedes - AMG are probably the best engine builders on this planet we inhabit. Your opinion is subjective, but fact is fact.

in that way it surpasses Ferrari indeed, where the interiors look like they have been designed by a 10 year old boy

I could never live with such an ugly interior."

2448,UgxE5AlmA6jKQGuOzml4AaABAg,"I never seen this car before until I got GRID 2, and when I tried the Huayra out, it immediately became my favorite car. Too bad I'll probably never get the chance to see nor sit in one in real life."
2449,Ugx_67evj4MAk4mcRQ94AaABAg,Its like a work of art. Everything is made to perfection.
2450,Ugxm1EUJZSqomdiMOIN4AaABAg,"this car looks so beautiful with all the doors open...

still like the looks of the zonda better just because it is more aggressive this is still incredible! "
2451,Ugxxl_apVZ9P1d5YNSB4AaABAg,Sweet looking car! If only I could afford it. :(

2454,UgwiELoUxrXvtm8MSLN4AaABAg,that is quite a masterpiece. seems like the kind that fixes all the problems a buggatti has... in my opinion

2461,UgzvgUWg0E3Y2gN8Wxl4AaABAg,"The only car I can really see giving this thing a run for it's money on the track is the Gumpert Apollo (the newest one). Unfortunately, the company went under, so I don't see Top gear reviewing it, despite the oldest one (S11, 2008) 7th fastest car they've ever had. 

It's got more power (800hp), it's lighter (1175gk), and is purely designed for speed, where as the Huayra is a mix of speed and luxury. 

Maybe Season 21.... (I can dream...)"
2462,UgwQ5l2-6GSLrfgpHAt4AaABAg,"I think the Huayra lost it's feminine side. Which is why I love the Zonda miles more than the Huayra. Still though, both are incredible without a doubt. "

the new 2014 C7 Z51 handles even better than the ZR1

Europeans that tested the C7 were completely blown away.

AND the 2014 camaro Z28  is a MONSTER(1.35 lateral G-forces.)

2470,UgxZyh8k7pnDqZxVXFl4AaABAg,Just thought I'd point out that the Veyron was technically modified and that there are indeed faster cars in the world.

"
2477,UgzVIQZj0cbhW1EP5Wd4AaABAg,The only problems i have with it is it needs different side mirrors and the interior looks like dogs sick but it's a good car.
2478,Ugx5ADt4DYbUMy0fXIZ4AaABAg,Lol I love Hammond

2486,UgyTzgE20rA5a1devYV4AaABAg,2:24 the cockpit reminds me of something straight out from final fantasy game..
2487,Ugw9DNTF_n7t6b2xKLV4AaABAg,It looks better than the zonda and is faster . Those flaps on the front are amazing haven't seen anything like it
2488,UgyWC05zJ6be6phD_zF4AaABAg,It went 267.8 mph and you should probably read the rest of my comments.

2490,UgwSpEWbWG_8mWTyeEF4AaABAg,"(continued) Lol, you seriously need to stop arguing about stuff you don't know a damn about. The ZR1 was using Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires, which are STOCK. The 2009 C6, the OLD ZR1, was slower, yes. But why are you using the old ZR1 as an example? Tons of lists without a single American car on them? Interesting, the top 5 fastest cars around Laguna Seca, tested by Motortrend, are all American. Very interesting...."
2491,UgxiQ7dwOE8cuA-a1sZ4AaABAg,Hammond even looks short in a supercar :p

What size? 1:18 scale or 1:24 scale?"

2498,UgyMc3SfhqeVrH58Yo54AaABAg,"The yanks finally have a car they can brag about. The ZR1 is there first real-i-am sports car, hence the constant citing as an example. IMO."

2500,UgwzGMwjjD-hr8mwCQ54AaABAg,"Amazing car. But seriously, it's just way too much. For that kind of money you can get 3 Aventadors for that kind of money. Or get McLaren, Aventador, Ferrari 458 and still have some change let for a small condo."

90,000x12=1,080,000

read the comment correctly next time"
2512,Ugz47Xed7qHD3yFsEfh4AaABAg,"I will just say it then...the Radical SR8 did a Nurburgring lap of 6:55 flat while the ZR1 did it in a lap time of 7:19.63. Radical is a British Company, and because the cars are kit cars, Radical can build it for you, or you can build it yourself.  That being said, it is cheaper than the ZR1. New it costs only ¬£60000.  CHEAPER. And let's assume that is the DIY price. It would be rediculous for Radical to charge and extra ¬£50000 for them to build the car for you. Radical is just better."
2513,UgxJH5FdTjFQp7squFF4AaABAg,I'd choose a 60 k Mercedes Benz or BMW over any american car any day

The SSC Ultimate Aero TT (American) has a theoretical top speed of 273 mph. The Hennessey Venom GT (American) has a theoretical top speed of 278 mph. BUT, the Venom DESTROYED the record for acceleration. The Bugatti Veyron SS did 0-200mph in 22 seconds. The Venom did it in 14 seconds.

Secondly, The Agera R has not yet proved its top speed, they say they will hopefully do it soon. Third, the Venom's record (265.7) did not actually beat the Veyron's (267.8).

Hennessey doesn't have a heritage and money to completely make his own cars from scratch like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Pagani and etc do, so this is what he built. and if you ask me, is a remarkable outcome.

2651,UgzpM1E-cTabp9e2ZlR4AaABAg,WOW. Listen to that Huayra!! This is my all time favourite car. Exotics are truly the best.
2652,UgxiMTiQnmwFWiHDmG94AaABAg,Different cars for different locations I guess :) I can see a Huayra winding through the hills of Northern Italy with ease
2653,UgynTVL0WoxVEa4P5ml4AaABAg,"VW did spend zillions on just the engine.

It's relatively easy to make an engine with a shit-ton of power. What's hard is to make a car that feels like a Rolls Royce at both 30km/h and 430km/h (suspension, transmission, aerodynamics, high-quality leather and good soundproofing)."
2654,UgyeIogK9PNMF2rsyLp4AaABAg,"im amazed at 1. how manly and gruff the engine sounds, i was expecting a zondaesque v12 shriek 2. how a twin plate clutch is 100kg heavier than a normal one..."
2655,Ugyy3FgamMXfcOxEtTh4AaABAg,"McLaren MP4-12C.

It has the ride-quality and comfort of a rolls if needed and can be as hard and direct as an F1 if needed.

Fully independent suspension (it doesn't even have anti-roll bars), unlike the 'Vette which still has Leaf-springs (yeah the shockabsorbers are getting there by the suspension is still affected by what the other wheel does. Not optimal)."

2657,Ugy_YfFbGugay62sYkZ4AaABAg,the most beautiful perfect machine created by man ever!
2658,UgzeV1FuU39a-uMQoR14AaABAg,"Great.

You've matched the performance. Now you just need to get the luxury, the design, the refinement and the build-quality to match. That's the reason euro-cars are usually that expensive.

Just look at how many concessions you've had to make to keep the ZR1 cheap. Cabin is crab and you've restricted the engine to keep it reliable (A supercharged 6.2 V8 that makes 620hp? We get that from a 3.6 Turbo Flat-6)."
2659,Ugx7FlUAfcAXHBHwzId4AaABAg,"Yes, its also about ride comfort, aesthetics, handling, and the ability to just look damn good while you're rolling along.
For ride comfort and handling I have an air ride suspension with smart fluid dampers. With a push of a button my truck can either ride like a rolls royce or a track car.
Aesthetics wise, the only thing still stock on her is the..um..frame. And a Big Black Truck goes a lot better with my Black Stetson than a Huayra."
2660,Ugx1hDHQITY9JgYKFXp4AaABAg,The worlds most amazing automobile.
2661,Ugw0iTImSAavM0wArHR4AaABAg,I can safely say that I put this vehicle in the same boat as the Koenigsegg and the Bugatti Veyron. Welcome to the club Huayra!
2662,UgzQin-o-gslDQG07i54AaABAg,"Good enough for Audi to win at Le Mans with. Diesel could use some more promotion that is for sure, diesel hybrids have yet to make an impact, though I think they have much more to offer than petrol hybrids."
2663,UgwlazySPRY-gImb_5h4AaABAg,"They've already tested that.

The car the Tesla is based on (the S2 Lotus Elise) handles better than the Tesla because it doesn't need to haul that great lump of batteries around."
2664,UgyswQM5HHS6nLwA3MR4AaABAg,Also BMW now has a range of diesel powered M-car with less hp than gas M-cars but with massive torque. They are so well engineered you can't hear any diesel noise.

2668,UgzzuOEFvFuWYq-QHDh4AaABAg,Brilliant review.
2669,UgzlxfCjXScAzkq7H_d4AaABAg,Actually it is about torque. The turbo diesel race engines you speak of have huge amounts of it.

2673,Ugwyqv9bmSG1IWdGMM54AaABAg,"Simply, sensational."
2674,UgzyzNp0RbedPOnpNld4AaABAg,"I'm talking about around a track. But in that case,
ZR1: 10.77
GT3 RS: 11.8 seconds
Definitely faster in a drag race, right? Still waiting for cars that are faster.  "
2675,Ugyvyfd6fhtZVRDXoWt4AaABAg,"Oh, I get the point of the Huayra, its an accessory for the driver. Just like his boots, watch, and wallet. Its art on wheels, no matter where you look at the car, there is something that will catch your eye, something to muse upon. Even the technology that went into parts you likely will never see, have their own aesthetic merits, along with their functional precision. What if the Big 3 were to put their collective patent registries together and place them in the hands of true artist? Imagine!"
2676,UgyqR8wxqRJ9oYyeWSJ4AaABAg,I hope Pagani can make a V8 hyper car in the meantime.
2677,UgzWraXU0ybNQYpPCT14AaABAg,"True, We Americans are pretty content with simply adding extra superchargers and remaining dominant in straight lines."

2684,UgwxoLv7sJZWW39ZA8B4AaABAg,"Of course.

However such finer details are usually lost on the ""bang for the buck"" crowd (usually dominated by the JDM and musclecar fans who don't see why anybody would bother buying a Porsche or Ferrari when a 370Z or Corvette does the same)."

"
2690,UgxWXTN9tlOiWueWSOt4AaABAg,"(continued) for (somewhat) luxury and performance. The ZR1 completely obliterates it in performance, because they aren't even in the same class as vehicles, and is less luxurious than the M5. Why? Because they are made for DIFFERENT purposes. The ZR1 is made for performance. The GT3 RS, Enzo, 458 Italia, Aventador, MP4-12C, Gallardo, etc are all European super cars made for performance and the ZR1 is faster than all of them. It is designed for speed, and it kicks ass in(continued)  "
2691,Ugy2b_8yz3VpK6MbZFZ4AaABAg,"Never said I wanted a Veyron. I'm more into the Zonda or Huayra.

Yeah the Veyron sounds hideous but that's because it was committee designed (most Oil Sheiks wanted a quiet car)."
2692,UgwwelZJGvfKJNcUcvF4AaABAg,"Please inform me of where I said that. At the end of the day, it's a freakin' $51,000 car. The fact you are trying to compare quality to a $450,000 car is idiotic."
2693,Ugxj3Lb1Y7yvKwz6MPF4AaABAg,AMG made its engine as well as every other Pagani produced.

2704,Ugz81VGrLRmm1O8g_Xx4AaABAg,"Still look great, though. Haha. But I recently saw a statistic that 85% of all Corvettes are still on the road/operational. I would like to see this statistic for Ferraris, Lambos, Maseratis, etc. "
2705,UgzMk0lFpVWNs3cGtBF4AaABAg,MOTHER OF CARS!!!
2706,UgzjtcUVhek9HM_5dzB4AaABAg,i'd like to know why are there so many guys talking about how powerful their trucks are.
2707,UgxE8kQVLQHn0F8MTZ54AaABAg,"Pretty sure your truck probably weighs at least 4 times as much as this car too.  HP and Torque mean nothing, it's all about Power to Weight ratio.  Something could have 1500 Horsepower and 1500 pounds of torque, but if it weigh 8000 pounds something with 800 hp and torque that only weighs 2400 will still be 3 times faster.  Not exact math but you should get the idea."
2708,UgzOF1sgd7NzJ0SToG94AaABAg,I was never talking about the Huayra. The ZR1 doesn't fall apart either but I would certainly hop that a $1.3 million Pagani doesn't fall apart.
2709,Ugz-Y7s4nZLSYf8Nomx4AaABAg,"You do understand it's not just horse power and torque, right..?"

2714,UgyY_EWwm1iAx2O5YeF4AaABAg,"Nice car, but I would choose the money, then would buy a GT-R for 1/10 of the price of this. "
2715,UgzUyClZOXfpjjT5RBV4AaABAg,"You get what you pay for I guess.

For $120.000 you get only performance, but for $300.000 you get performance, luxury and refinement.

Guess I'll just save up then."
2716,Ugx2wqrsy-XnucLEq5t4AaABAg,"That's crazy talk, crazy :)"
2717,UgxDhrQmRDwh_LJBvAN4AaABAg,Im pretty sure that richard can afford dat
2718,UgzqrwBM7gTvxH1ndEF4AaABAg,"well, no safe, street legal, comfortable way. No way that would cost less than ¬£800k"
2719,UgxoHbB7NxWmVfgbfLB4AaABAg,"Yeah, sure.

This being manufactured in Italy
The name was taken from the Argentinean god of wind and other race car the Ford Pronello Huayra, an SP Argentinean.
The designer and founder of the brand is Argentine, Horacio Pagani.
What more?
Otherwise we would have to say, for example, that Chevrolet would of their origins, Swiss genius.
Please ..."
2720,UgxamCXGy43jeUzSsa94AaABAg,"-STILL has a better spectrum of power and torque delivery. And on top of that, VW needed BILLIONS of dollars to develop that engine. The Venom's engine was ""made"" by a tuner in him shop in Texas. Lol, you want to talk about an embarrassment, look at that."
2721,UgxFVI9lnRD2cxb35BV4AaABAg,"And thats how you beat it. By making a car that looks better, goes faster, rides smoother, gets better milage, and has more power, all the while still being within the same price bracket as a Corvette."
2722,UgxvYbyfvySmgIeKnWd4AaABAg,There is no way a muscle car can be quicker than this Huayra
2723,UgyWWQcNxakmxnUld-h4AaABAg,"Completely agree, they're dire looking. Way too high and antennae looking. And don't let anybody tell me they're that way because of wind tunnel results. They just lost it and spoiled an otherwise vey pretty car"
2724,UgyLPDI6N-hU46vGRcR4AaABAg,"You must really have short term memory loss. You mentioned the build quality of a Noble, so I was talking about the Noble M600, which, guess what?! Costs $450,000. 10X better my ass. Haha, the Aventador is no where near 10x. But still, you are dragging this on into a completely different argument. Once again, name a European super car that matches the performance of a ZR1 without quadrupling the price."
2725,Ugx4h8GG0QJiRdCwWlR4AaABAg,"Yeah, and you're spending nearly $2 million for that. If I'm going to buy a car for that much money, I want it to be loud and fun and I want to to sound good. That Bugatti sounds hideous. If I wanted an expensive luxury car I would buy a Bentley or Rolls Royce. "
2726,UgwNu_If3sBxCKhl70B4AaABAg,"Don't worry man, I know where you're coming from. But I don't see a point in trying to beat this. It doesn't look good and nobody can afford it.."
2727,Ugwqklm-55UBRcsVskh4AaABAg,"I know, I already said I'm ignoring your attempt to change the subject. I'm not even reading your comments.
What European super car is faster than a ZR1 without quadrupling the price?"
2728,Ugwf-Jhy0-eCconopX54AaABAg,a muscle car cant beat a Lamborghini aventador or maybe Gallardo  so theres no way that it could beat a zonda 
2729,UgyHG1WPNgVoxm4mD094AaABAg,"Aw.

Well he started it >_<"
2730,UgxIHpOT1L6XGXiiabB4AaABAg,"It is a special occasion, so I wont use the paddles to shift into 6th gear"
2731,Ugzna0ZM_0ZpSUX3EAx4AaABAg,euro cars are also more expensive because a lot of them have hand-crafted or precision cut components that take a long time to make and therefore need more energy and labour costs. look at the huayra. 24 hours for the name badge alone and 5 days for each wheel. not to mention the extreme heat needed to make the carbon fibre and other exotic materials
2732,UgwchgNgAlGlnCV6myt4AaABAg,"never compare american muscle to european muscle, its like comparing a dog and a cat"
2733,UgxFjdvfqMlWmbUvP3B4AaABAg,America can definitely make a motor. America can definitely make a chassis. American can definitely not make a suspension that can compete with this hypercar with what we're currently offering. Will America do it? I hope so.
2734,Ugw_fvx_h6mOlRXQaQZ4AaABAg,"No but you brought up the GT-R in a discussion about european sportscars.

And yes the LS9 makes mountains of torque. Too much in fact. You'll spin the tires each time you set off (apparently that's where the GT2 RS wins the 2 seconds on the ZR1 on the Ring).

1.3mpg isn't enough of a reason to double the size of the engine. And the Mezger doesn't have a direct advantage. Just a technological one (think downsizing which will be required in the future)."
2735,UgzYDy5qJlKisjgTSZp4AaABAg,"Did you read my comment? I said it's important, that you can put the torque on the track. If you have 1000 HP and a lot of torque, but only small tires or only front wheel drive it will get you nowhere."
2736,UgzJLJOD0Qu-EKvZA7d4AaABAg,"Lol, what European car matches the performance of a ZR1 Corvette without quadrupling. "
2737,UgxLSHdqbfM4ppOCJR14AaABAg,"Your definition is slightly imprecise.  Selling out is doing something you don't want to do to make money.  A ruder way of saying it could be, ""whoring out the brand image"".

Liking money, in and of itself isn't a bad thing.  It's when you blind yourself from the fact that you can make money AND enjoy what you do."

2742,UgwqpVKp8hq-0nbuRPt4AaABAg,"Um, I think you need to check the patent registry. America, namely Cadillac, owns the patent on both forms of smart fluid dampers used in all those hypercars suspension. Audi only has the patent in Germany, and to sell their cars outside Germany with that suspension they have to pay a royalty to Cadillac.
And Cadillac has been using the tech since the late 80's. They just haven't used it for high performance cars until now."

I've already talked about this so I'm not going to repeat it if you chose to ignore it. The C6 is made of cheap materials because it is a relatively cheap car.

2750,UgxAMJxWtrRZtbo7pRV4AaABAg,"(continued) that department (fact). Luxury was not a focus of the ZR1. Why? Because it's 3 times less expensive.

It get's about 4mph worse on the highway than the ZR1. Easier to drive? Maybe on the limit but around time it's a very controllable car. You would probably argue it's easier based solely on the fact that the M5 has an automatic. Visit the workshop less often. Now this is hilarious because Chevy is statistically a far more reliable brand. YOUR argument is invalid.

Porsche, Audi, Lamborghini, McLaren, Ferrari...  these are iconic supercars which perform astonishingly well in circuits and drags. Corvette doesn't have the technology that the other European supercars have, it doesn't have the pedigree, and it is no match against any Euro cars. You can get better Euro supercars for the price of a corvette:Porsche GT3/2, Audi R8, Lambo Gallardo is close to the same price.
"
2771,Ugz4kIByn09XOwUxeSl4AaABAg,"I never said the GT-R was European. It's a common fact it's a Nissan. That Veyron excuse is pathetic. VW gave BILLIONS to produce that car. That engine is a byproduct of that money.
 A ZR1 produces 638 hp and 604 lb torque. The GT2 produces 620 hp and 516 lb torque. That is A LOT less torque, and once again, the LS9 is lighter, more efficient, has a better range of hp and torque delivery, and above all, sounds better. So what's the advantage of the Porsche's engine? Smaller displacement?"
2772,Ugx3ATtVDCb-WU5nm7B4AaABAg,"3 points.

1: The GT-R is JDM, not a european sportscar.

2: I said Turbocharged 3.6 FLAT-6 not V6.

3: The 3.6 FLAT 6 is in the Porsche 997 GT2 RS. And even if that's relatively spartan it's still using materials much more luxurious than the Daewoo Cruze cabin of the 'Vette.

Also the Veyron was never made to be an efficient sportscar. Not to mention the Venom GT feels like what it is. A homemade kitbash kit-car."

2779,Ugwk0YqN8TIuh9CfVC14AaABAg,"Every company has a lot of patents, so GM is not especial in that area. GM has magnetic suspension which AFTER development Ferrari start to use. I hope you, even in wildest dreams, are no suggesting that Ferrari is using the same sort of suspension as in GM cars. They took an idea and improved on it.

GM and Ford each by them self are bigger than, Ferrari, Aston Marin, Porsche, Maserati, Lamborghini and Pagani COMBINED. Your telling us they cant build (forget hyper car) a single super car? "
2780,Ugz8uSC_pRJzfVxlKrx4AaABAg,"i dont like how richard states lamborghini is basically a sell out...the company was bankrupt so they had to sell it, they had no other option. Ferrari on the other hand is a sellout."
2781,UgyGmVMtzufcC-4Ow6t4AaABAg,How about you do the same and then do a patent search on who owns that technology. It will completely deflate your view of European automakers. 
2782,UgymY1MZ3WmYxIiShTd4AaABAg,and dont forget Audi.
2783,UgzYqyOwUq4DRalPzSp4AaABAg,"Mate.

As long as people want to build light and balanced sportscars, battery cars wont be considered the future.

Batteries are heavy and cumbersome. Why not use a proper next-gen power-source like 2nd Gen Bio-fuel (made from waste-products like straw) or Hydrogen (internal combustion OR fuel-cell).

If given the choice I'd rather have the car the Tesla Roadster is based on (the Lotus Elise S2) because that's better balanced and lighter."
2784,UgzT1YANB1VbuFPl51N4AaABAg,"Maybe a little bit more luxury, but definitely not refinement. With any other super car, their suspensions will be naturally very stiff. So driving on the road will be very rough. With the ZR1, it has magnetic ride control which allows you to change to suspension stiffness to suit where you are driving. For an extra $180,000 you can get slightly better seats and better materials in the cabin. I'd rather spend $180,000 less and get after-market parts if it's necessary. "

If it's a hydraulic system incorporated independently into the ALREADY hydraulic shock-absorbers WITHOUT any actual BARS then it doesn't have anti-roll bars.

And no it doesn't match it. It surpasses it. It's better. It provides more confidence in corners and is softer and more refined on bumpy roads. It switches seamlessly from Rolls Royce flying carpet to Formula 1 granite block depending on your driving."

We make engines that perform the best. You want to brag about how you can create smaller, less effective engines? What about the German engineered Veyron which needs an 8,0 quad-turbo charged W16 to produced 1,001 hp and 922 lbs of torque? While the Venom GT uses a 7.0L twin turbocharged V8 to produce 1,244 hp and 1,155 lb of torque. And it-"
2792,UgxaNLuweml4Cx-jT0F4AaABAg,"Because it is a big deal. There are no European super cars that can match the performance of the ZR1 unless they are nearing a million dollars. What you said would be more correct if backwards. What defines a cars materials is the the price. Chevy has a limit to how much the car is going to cost. They could use better materials, but it would cost more than they want it to cost. Why were you comparing the quality of the materials then if you just said the price is a factor of it?

The Huayra is like the last bastion of that, one man's vision of what a sportscar / supercar should be, and should look like. Can't buy one myself, but thank god cars like this still exist."
2869,UgyRSYuk0DMryhEMSZt4AaABAg,Best looking car ever made
2870,UgwYeNTSpS8dXftKRlJ4AaABAg,It's funny how Richard thinks the Huayra was meant to usurp the Zonda when Mr Pagani clearly said the Huayra wasn't meant ursurp anything.
2871,Ugy4V91IYZD4gWgeiS54AaABAg,"I like what he said about Pagani just trying to make great cars, while Lamborghini and Ferrari (while still awesome) focus on all of this other crap nowadays. And then there are the timers on all of the stations when they are building the cars. They may be high tech but they are more ""mass-produced"" and stamped-out now. Pagani and Koenigsegg are true hypercar builders."
2872,UgxPxlbEbLqz02CheQp4AaABAg,"Clarkson:""Oh look a corner..... Oh look I'm upside down"""
2873,UgzZ82bTUAT39x6c-Nt4AaABAg,I love how he acts like he can't buy one
2874,UgyahjvJiUhK8mZO8PN4AaABAg,Love Pagani!
2875,UgzklheszWErTztlq9N4AaABAg,i think its brilliant that Richard still has the little boy inside him. shows that most men like to have fun in a great car. he is also one of the luckiest guys on the planet. he gets to test drive some of the fastest cars on the planet and he gets paid for it. every mans dream job i think
2876,UgwgRFcYPLBwhk1juzN4AaABAg,At last the Huayra :D
2877,UgzKaReR_5dt-Ycz3CJ4AaABAg,"can't believe this did a 1,13 laptime"

2881,Ugx_gMsTlbqxC9J86xJ4AaABAg,"30 years time?
it'll take longer than that but yes, some countries will convert to electric and i bet it'll be the smaller ones first."
2882,UgxXuPpcbwqmxVUswoB4AaABAg,It has a car similar to this. You can see it in the second trailer.
2883,Ugx8KX4J1zjWLMF-pfJ4AaABAg,1.32 THAT ENGINE
2884,Ugx954XyTIhaW3-EF_d4AaABAg,"Yea, this is my favorite too!"
2885,Ugz3gcYTh_5x6Bcvcs14AaABAg,Replacing the clutch in that thing probably costs more than an used NSX or GT-R.

2889,UgwCjLxhP6cBnI_inIN4AaABAg,Its not a car its a monster :)
2890,UgxuiChUzRW7dPc1Ahp4AaABAg,"Love the steampunk interior, the aerodynamics shifting flaps but why not develop your own engine in-house and make it hybrid/electric like other brave manufacturers... unless you want to be a slave to the oil men between now and when oil runs out in 30 years time. And 2WD? Come on... AWD (All Wheel Drive) wins the rally trophies since the mid-80s!"
2891,UgzF3i-MfHS1on5bpVJ4AaABAg,To add to it the first car with Angel Doors was the 1986 Alfa Romeo Carbo. So it's not like Mercedes invented them......

2900,UgydRLVyiW9K_q4b2Ft4AaABAg,For me the king of the wall is still a lambo for me in particular a white aventador
2901,Ugyja_VPWWHvNdcIOP94AaABAg,"I wonder when someone is going to make a diesel powered supercar? My truck has more power (HP and massively more torque) than this car. I'd love to see a true ""GT"" muscle car that could wipe the floor with this car! Can America Do It? Yes we can! Will America Do It? We shall see."
2902,Ugzo43363mFqDej-1Ch4AaABAg,At least pagani gives you an amazing interior for tat price tag. Still overpriced IMHO
2903,UgzIw8ySEtQ-k_lUzal4AaABAg,"the zonda used slick tires on the power lap, everyone knows that...and in case you dont know...it makes alot of difference...im pretty sure the aventador with slick tires is faster then the zonda...."

2905,UgzRGe9dRLXGLKCgtw94AaABAg,"A human takes 9 months aprox to be conceived, usually lives 3/4 of a century in a varying emotional and physical environment. That to me is more impressive"
2906,UgzXk--sguAAq8c-7Yh4AaABAg,The interior is second to none but the Zonda's exhaust notes sound better.
2907,Ugw1BZWjq2JFyg3MLPN4AaABAg,"7:39 lol, his face, and also watch from 7:38 do it do it."
2908,Ugxd7BlUZAkZQ_DC0FR4AaABAg,"Specially for Pagani.  No other car has that engine.  I think it was a smart decision for Pagani to use an engine from AMG instead of designing their own, because they know it works.  The car is built very well of course, and for one million dollars, it needs to be reliable."
2909,UgyAqJkXbia-nLKJoR14AaABAg,I might get one for my Gardener .
2910,Ugx4KMLyGQLOTuf15at4AaABAg,Do it! Do it! Do it!

2921,UgwVTY2Cu3V1-CIY0gR4AaABAg,"Guys, the mirrors were long to sustain a more aero design, and the mirror itself was inspired by a womans eye. If u look at the LaFerrari, it has similar mirrors, but the Huayra has much better ones"
2922,UgxFaTFJ_EHvoPBjXdV4AaABAg,i heard they say that if you buy 2 the third is 1/2 price

2928,UgyYy5cjYZmsCDX7xQJ4AaABAg,awesome car i think this car is much better than bugatti veyron super sport
2929,Ugyl19ddqkbCy2aRFdR4AaABAg,"no, Mercedes doesn't own Pagani, they just build the engines for them"

2978,UgygV8OCzLk5joMiFMV4AaABAg,I hope those people that complain about the quality knows this is not new. It's just a little segment from past episodes and seasons.
2979,Ugz13_zBA4e5s1tuAad4AaABAg,betcha the side mirrors wont last
2980,Ugy3FD1PYY1CADEmZuJ4AaABAg,"oh give me a break... the engine is made by... hmmmmm? oh yea, MERCEDES."

2982,UgzCZd4v41Jo2J1Pwi94AaABAg,"you cant compare them. la ferrari ist nearly racing car, pagani has still a lot of luxury"
2983,Ugz3RxrX2mpAdW78Xdd4AaABAg,nice!
2984,Ugwl5C3Z_MXh0EN3r3x4AaABAg,"i saw a documentary with the ""making of the huayra"" and Pagani said that he wanted the mirrors to look like a womans eye.......so thats the reasoning behind it. I ALSO aint feeling the look of the mirrors tho, but oh well"
2985,UgyZlfm0xGQnLJxSdOx4AaABAg,"Doesn't matter if it's specifically for Pagani or not. Since Pagani themselves can't make an engine,  they are therefore dependent on a third party to make it for them. This reliance is pretty similar to Ferrari or Lambo. Mercedes controls a pretty huge factor in their equation and therefore probably has a say in what happens. Besi des, who's to say the components on the Aventador is not specifically designed for it?

I'd say Koenigsegg is more of fitting of the independent praise."
2986,UgzpRVSjd6y6MGy2wJB4AaABAg,Do it Do it Do it :)
2987,UgyFxlAySDQNKTJnafN4AaABAg,"Huayra?   (say UAYRA Richard, not HUAYRA) "
2988,UgzmLf2gN6x0yYwwcOV4AaABAg,Yeah there are faster there is no doubt ... but this is a PAGANI it has a lot more pedigree and caracter (soul if you prefer ) and it is also a hypercar ...but the huayra is two years older than Laferrari or the P1... so wait a little and you will see how Pagani will smash those two !!
