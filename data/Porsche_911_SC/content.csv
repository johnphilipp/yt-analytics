This is the theme song from the Movie "" Love Story "" (1970) with Ryan O'Neil and Ali McGraw.  That fits with the love story in this Porsche commercial. 
Also in the film it was just music, no singing, then Andy Williams first recorded the song with Lyrics. Shirley Bassey recorded it as well. The song is called (Where do I begin ? ) Love story."

59,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg,That‚Äôs a stunning looking car. I hope you‚Äôll sell them to enthusiasts who will drive them.
60,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79bJ7N3W75e1,"@Pineapple Tacos I have asked for all generations for 12 years, to be clear, I own one 911 (the same one for 17 years serviced at Bain dealer) and other nice sports cars, I am not desperate to get a GT3, I would really just love to get one, so much so that it would be the first new car I ever buy. And it seems that I am not worthy. As a matter of principle, I won't buy a second hand car at RRP or a premium to RRP if I tried/asked to buy it new. At this point of time, I will probably buy anything but a 911 GT3 because I am fed up and will buy a car because I will moving to another country. So I am looking at GT3 competitors which are cheaper (Exige etc.) or more expensive (Maclaren, Lamborghini etc.)."
61,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79bJ4Lxf6BW8,@Photoandcargeek You also didn‚Äôt specify that you were trying to spec/order one. You just said you‚Äôve tried to BUY ONE only to be told no or supposedly that you‚Äôre not worthy. I‚Äôve known numerous people who were told no at one dealership who‚Äôve gone to another one who said yes. Waiting 12 years or more is just laughable to me.
62,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79bJ3ekioZwv,"@Photoandcargeek I completely understand it, but until now the GT3‚Äôs typically have NOT been sold at a massive markup, neither new nor slightly used. That unfortunate trend seems to have only become an issue over the past 7/8 years or so. Porsche frowns upon its dealers marking their cars up to the insanely high prices that other brands dealers do (like $150k+ for $75k C8, $130k+ for a $50/$60k Bronco or $270k for a $110/$115k new HUMMER EV). It‚Äôs just odd hearing all these supposed horror stories from folks when I‚Äôve walked into two different Porsche dealerships in two different states and ordered two separate cars from people & dealers I‚Äôve never dealt with before - one of which was a GT3. The other was a 991.2 Targa 4 GTS AND I‚Äôve already spec‚Äôed a GT4 RS that I‚Äôm currently waiting on to be delivered. I‚Äôm not the only member of my family or person I‚Äôm aware of that‚Äôs done this either."

65,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79b6ppzBExvU,"@Pineapple Tacos because the used was at the price before going higher of the new which I think is irrational and if I am going to pay that, I would rather order mine new to my taste. Also I have multiple cars and not in a hurry to get one, also that I thought I would wait 4 years max, then agreed with myself 8 especially because there was a world recession but I still asked for a car and didn't get it.
And by the way, I am not playing mister sensitive, it is my money, I spend it how I want. If I don't want to spend the price of new or much more than the price of new for a used car, of which I have had many in my life, I don't. Also, having a little bit of patience in life is not a bad thing but people going crazy and overhyping objects, people buying new cars they don't want to make a profit in 3-6 months is inherently a bad thing and for multiple strategic reasons, Porsche shouldn't sell them cars. (You never know when you are going to fall into the ""Burberry effect"", you know when at first your brand gets exposure but then it collapses because it gets the attention of the wrong people for the brand).
If you don't understand any of that then too bad for you."
66,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79b6ZblNkbSb,"@Kyusha Coming from a family packed full of both auto enthusiasts and Porsche fanatics AND the fact that I actually DO have an IQ over 50 I‚Äôm very well aware of what the car is, but thanks for reiterating what we all saw in this very video Caption Obvious. But saying just because it IS a limited edition vehicle that enthusiasts won‚Äôt buy it is one of the most (if not THE most) ridiculous bunch of nonsense I‚Äôve ever heard. 911R‚Äôs, Speedsters and even the most recent 911 Targa 4S Heritage Edition have *ALL* been purchased by enthusiasts. Maybe not totally & completely by enthusiasts but they still WERE bought by them. Saying they won‚Äôt is just as equally asinine as saying someone isn‚Äôt a true enthusiast if they don‚Äôt work on their own cars ‚Äî which, just for the record, is probably one of THE stupidest things I‚Äôve ever heard uttered."
67,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79b6WrmVOEYA,"@Photoandcargeek Why the hell have you ‚Äúbeen trying to buy‚Äù one for 12 years? There‚Äôs this nifty tiny little segment out there know as the USED car market. And for well over the last 12 years there‚Äôs been GT3‚Äôs, GT3 RS‚Äôs, GT2 RS‚Äôs and every other model in their lineup available in that segment of the market - typically with low to almost no miles on them whatsoever. Also not always at a Porsche dealership. So instead of being Mr Sensitive and getting all butthurt over what a dealer supposedly said to you, why - if you TRULY wanted a GT3 that badly - would you not explore ALL of your options? That just doesn‚Äôt even make sense to me."

69,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79b5fGdUzvF8,"@Pineapple Tacos I wish that what you‚Äôve described here was actually the case at the moment. Unfortunately, just about everything on PORSCHE dealer lots are going for well over msrp (aside from run of the mill Macans and Cayennes). Was at my local dealer a couple of weeks ago and saw $50k markups on both a 992 911 GTS and Taycan Sport Turismo GTS. At the time, even placing a deposit in the hope of securing an allocation for a 992 GTS required agreement to purchase at $25k over sticker. #1 on that list for allocation agreed to $80k over sticker. Since then, they‚Äôve actually declined any deposits for ‚Äúsports cars due the uncertainty around future delivery times‚Äù. Likely different scenarios depending on various markets and dealerships but not a good time for a normal guy like me to be trying to secure an allocation for anything (plus, out of principal, I‚Äôm not willing to pay over sticker)."
70,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79awExqS3MpX,"Even though I couldn't possibly afford this car,  I'm still mad that Porsche limited production to just 1,250 of these cars.  That means that even years down the line when a person wants to buy one with 125,000 miles it'll still be worth $80,000."

104,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79aMe_OnMATJ,"@Kyusha LOL Really? What about the Carrera GT? The 911R? Or even the 918 for that matter? Then there‚Äôs the 997 Sport Classic that enthusiasts & collectors alike flocked to. And look at the 718 GT4 RS. NOT a limited model, no, but a model that a MASSIVE amount of non-Porschphile‚Äôs claimed wouldn‚Äôt be a hit nor would enthusiasts be interested in but they‚Äôre not only selling like mad BUT there‚Äôs a 2+ year wait list to get one."
105,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79aMc1VBU9Ij,"@Nikesh Sharma I don‚Äôt think so. Porsche, like many companies, has gotten a little pissed at dealerships who‚Äôve done it in the past. Them being the company that they are (one who prides itself on both listening to what their customers like/want/don‚Äôt want AND making them happy have threatened pulling their ‚Äúauthorized dealer‚Äù status and/or refusing any further allocations they may be due. Now if only other companies would follow their lead & do the same with their dealerships we wouldn‚Äôt see Hummer EV‚Äôs at $250/$275k when they retail at $110/$115k. Or $50k Broncos selling for $100-$150k."
106,Ugx6bgeRQkU1B1juDEN4AaABAg.9aLIbULYbI79aMLghjPQqV,real enthusiasts won't buy a limited model in the first place

229,UgzfkMSpAtxJM-Pix0h4AaABAg,"""The 911"" has always been the benchmark. Like it or hate it, it always drives beautifully, it always gives you great feedback while driving and it has a distinctive look. For example, if you hear a train of GT3 cars come by, you hear V8s and V10s all together. Very nice and all, but then there is that one GT3 R that sings with 9000 rpm, with the cute beetle eyes ready to take on whoever has the biggest displacement and beat them in the corners. BIG fan of the GT3 R..

My dad used to own a 911 so I was grown to love them eventually, which would make me obviously biased. But that doesn't take away from the perfection that Porsche is aiming for. This brand will continue to turn heads in EV times, the Taycan has got some negative backlash, but if you are going to take a drive, IMO that's the only EV that's made with passion for driving instead of joining in on the hype. Change my mind."

It's all about making an emotional connection to a time, place, and lifestyle that most people didn't realize they aspire to. It is a truly brilliant marketing piece. Congratulations Porsche, I don't know how many cars you will sell because of this, but I do know you've somehow touched many many hearts."

272,UgzqP5X4ZXgUj0LSr714AaABAg,I love everything about this film ‚Äúexcept‚Äù a vintage Leica M3 in the old footage and perhaps a new Leica M in the 911 R. This could have been a great collaboration with Leica especially when you consider that an ‚ÄúM‚ÄùLeica user is an enthusiast that prefers manual controls. They are both brand loyal to the point of true fanaticism and ‚Äúfind‚Äù the $ to pursue their passions. Heh Porsche if you like my idea ? in lieu of payment I would prefer to become a more ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù driver ‚Ä¶ and if you have an extra 911 R gathering dust somewhere perhaps you could loan it to me in which case I would do my best to put a million miles on it in less then 10 yrs. before going to a more deserving spot in your museum. By the way did you ever get my letter about using  the voice of Marlene Dietrich for your computer/navigation system ?

402,UgzVMYSJXF50I2jWhd14AaABAg,"Lovely car.  Of course, you won't be able to buy one unless you've already bought 5 cars from your local Porsche dealer in recent years, and you'll still have to pay $70k over MSRP for it."

The rest will be bought by the super rich, driven for a few hundred miles and then sold for a profit within the first few months. Then after that they will remain in someone's collection for many many years barley being driven. 
I don't have a problem with them remaining in a collection, it's just the jerks that bought them 1st and sold them for a profit. That sucks."

544,UgzB0mtJc61h67Zw70Z4AaABAg,Ein sehr sch√∂nes Auto! Ich hab aber noch ein paar Gedanken zu dem Video: 1. Es ist ganz wichtig das nur der Mann f√§hrt! ‚ÄúFrau am Steuer ungeheuer‚Äù sagt man ja 2. Ich hab das Gef√ºhl das die Zeit Achsen der Charaktere falsch sind. Der Alte Porsche der zusehen ist ist auf jeden Fall ein Modell irgendwann vor der Baureihe 993 (genauer kann ich es nicht sagen) und damit mal min. 30 alt. Entweder Porsche Fahrer:innen halten sich gut im Alter oder da stimmt was nicht. 3. In der R√ºckblende wirken die Charaktere eher so Mitte/Ende zwanzig fahren aber trotzdem schon Porsche. Ungew√∂hnlich irgendwie. Es suggeriert als h√§tten sie schon ihren ersten Porsche geerbt. Ich finde das klingt nach einer langweiligen Geschichte. Naja LG ans Team und alle Porsche Fahrer
