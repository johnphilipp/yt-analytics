They began work in a former factory that was used by the Nazis, yes, but the company itself was essentially brand new. The name, despite what people think, isn't a reflection of Nazism either. Hitler named the car ""KDF-Wagen"" or ""Strenght Through Joy Car"". The VW factory, wanting to distance itself from the Nazis (at this point under control of the British occupation forces) renamed the factory to ""Volks Wagen"" and began production of the formerly prototype KDF Wagen, which would become known as the VW Type 1, or Beetle."

284,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg,It was so beautiful when the Centodieci stood with the EB110!!!!! 2 icons of their time sharing the same frame!!!!
285,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cVbIacD8jO,In what way in this CENTO an icon?
286,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cUoChItYmF,"@Nick Growing up I loved the EB110, then they released the veyron, it was like a slap in the face to anybody who actually wanted to drive their car. Considering every bugatti since the veyron looks like a veyron with a chinese bodykit I start to question the current vision of the company"
287,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cUnpWib099,"@Toyota Nerd !!!! I completely agree, the veyron looked like a beetle to me (the insect not the car)"
288,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cUVXnTIy66,@Calvin Kruger I think the Chiron lookes better then the Veyron. The Veyron always bored me astheticly
289,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cTLLQ5wLbk,As soon as I saw that colour I knew what was coming. . .

291,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cSzwwaOYtP,"@Nick Comparing this to the EB110 is sad. Since the veyron they seem to have forgotten how to design a new car, any decent body shop would be able to convert a veyron to chiron to centodicki or back, I understand the technology and mechanics have changed but holy cow can they just get somebody to design a body that isn't a 12 year olds idea of a veyron bodykit. Absolute loss of aesthetical originality"
292,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cNxL0GfV4c,@Nick and it looks a lot better
293,Ugw7zg3rPd7wjordpn14AaABAg.9cFMqoE7LFm9cIcrX65EcA,"One is chiron with new name, the second,is a italian monster,100%Made in italy, EB110üáÆüáπ"

295,UgyvpB1OjJqFpZZsBvN4AaABAg,"When the new Bugatti was launch in the early 1990's, it was missing one major point to it design, french flare and not Italian. A questions, check out the original company's fantastic designs"
296,UgzW3cj6zwxF6KiME1x4AaABAg,"Imagine being able to get one of these one day. One day maybe, hard work and dedication!"
297,UgziEo6C8uNqG7otS8V4AaABAg,This is the perfect harmony between the high tech and design.
298,UgwXH8QP4DPE6ZTyUP94AaABAg,"I actually prefer the older ones shape, i really wish they brought it back in some way but i love the features of the new."
299,Ugz6ZFidA6F2kmZAuEJ4AaABAg,"Wow! The Bugatti team should be very proud after creating this masterpiece! Someone is going to be very, very happy."
300,Ugz6ZFidA6F2kmZAuEJ4AaABAg.9cFK86yXHD89cWK6bLNx2V,@misterX misterY That would be a sad thing because this Centodieci was built to run. It would be a big waste of all the amazing engineering and passion that was put into this car.
301,Ugz6ZFidA6F2kmZAuEJ4AaABAg.9cFK86yXHD89cW8Ru4nFMn,Probably the one who bought it doesn't care about it other than to sell it off in few years. Will be stored in some warehouse. Like with all these other extremely limited editions.

342,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cOi9Fdtnv2,"@Pain is Coming While I see your point, these billionaires often have a philanthropic side, donating tens of millions to charitable causes around the world.

You can consider that tens of millions are a drop in the ocean compared to what most of them spend on personal material objects, or when compared to their entire net worth.

It should be noted that without them, those tens of millions wouldn't be there, and the less fortunate who benefit from that funding would have to go without.

All that being said, we should also be cautious when celebrating the philanthropic endeavors of the mega rich, because charitable donations are a tax incentive, and are also often directed toward causes that are beneficial to the donor in some way.

When we talk about global wealth percentage, if you're an American with a net worth of $93,170, you're among the global top 10%, and with only $4,210, you're richer than half the world's residents."

349,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cNvYYw1JQi,"@BadMannerKorea Glad we agree some are completely blind to the world suffering. ""It's not my problem, therefore there is no problem"". 

With this mentality the poor will always die. I wonder what will happen when only the rich remains, maybe your thinking will have changed. Just kidding, you won't be there you will be erased by those you blindly supported."
350,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cNu0-D97Mi,@BadMannerKorea i know the financial situation of those dying of hunger. It's bad. Very bad.

You should buy something cheaper and donate to the rest of the world. There's a lot of suffering going on and you're not entitled to buy anything you want, you need to give it away."
352,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cNt95Ovrmm,"@Pain is Coming No, it isn't nonsense because you don't know his financial situation. It's possible that car is the equivalent percentage as somebody buying a Toyota Camry. It's possible he donates more than all the donations of everybody you've ever known in your life. You have zero moral right or argument to act like somebody can't buy a car they want with their money, and it's arguable they're not obligated to donate or help out anybody."
353,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cNptWde7hG,"@BadMannerKorea whatever, ll I'm saying is that these people lost touch with humanity. They have the means to do change while we are here arguing about what is humane or not. Take a picture of children dying of hunger, take a picture of a $3m car and the billionnaire will take the car. This is non sense on every single level so no need to respond to me saying I don't know the guy. I know the guy, he showed me already who he was and it's not a comment that will change my mind. 

This is the reason why humanity is hurting right now, non humans pretending to be humans so that humans defend them. You don't know them either and yet you defend them. He could laugh daily at poor people for all we know, get my point ?"
354,Ugx3l0vWPuS2ZaU93vV4AaABAg.9cLSAfWzZsl9cNmYs5olaz,"@Pain is Coming If you had that kind of money you too would be nice things for yourself, and owning a car like that doesn't mean the person who bought it can't help or doesn't help in other ways. It's not one or the other, you do realize that, right? You're making judgements about somebody you don't even know. People who amass a lot of money tend to add value to the economy, and it's possible the person who bought this car already donates a lot of money. Look at Bill Gates...."

374,UgyewrP3x7EiR2vVobF4AaABAg,"Dear Bugatti Team, I rarely show any facial expressions let alone laugh, when watching comedy alone for example, but this video made my eyes pop and my jaw drop, LITERALLY. I am truly amazed. Been a fan of the EB110 ever since having a bBurago model as a child and this design is very well worthy for sharing its name with that. Well done."

387,UgwHIDKwfl2CAG5989d4AaABAg,"Unfortunately the era of truly beautiful cars without limits is long gone. You can see it in the first few seconds when the 2 cars approach eachother. It simply wouldn't be possible (or should I say legal) to make a car with such a low front and low headlights these days. This is what made these cars so unique, and easy to spot from a mile away. Bugatti EB, Ferrari F40, Ford GT. Yes the new Ford GT is a magnificent piece of kit, but also look and compare it with the previous gen and the original and you will see what I mean."
388,UgwP421HLDBcxvYQTJl4AaABAg,Wow! I thought this was just some crazy concept car. What a special moment.
389,UgwvnZ6m2QFjq54iOgN4AaABAg,"I honestly love how they managed to port a design language from every model they've made, onto the Centodiece! It's like the Centodiece tells the companies story without even uttering a word! Honestly a breathtaking car, I wish I could afford it. üò≥"

But buying a performance car.....so it can just sit in your garage, is just stupid to me.  

It would be like buying a one-of-a-kind Remington rifle....and never shooting it.  

And, will this thing beat a Plaid at the light???? LOL"
394,UgwvnZ6m2QFjq54iOgN4AaABAg.9cMeUssRqCc9cTUYVcfQKs,@Sahadi420 Nothing wrong with treating a car like a piece of art. No matter if its a 14 million dollar car or a rusty old f250.
395,UgwvnZ6m2QFjq54iOgN4AaABAg.9cMeUssRqCc9cTH00dwiyZ,"so you can put in it your garage....never to be driven again??? LOL

Don't get me wrong....I love the ""ultimate in performance"" and all that, but the ""ultimate"" cars now are so ludicrously priced now, they're more works of art, than performance cars.    

They say this will go for 14 million.......just stupid.  It's literally like art.  People with more money than they know what to do with dropping tens of millions on some drawings."
396,UgxGonAItt77L2BQk9p4AaABAg,Beautiful car! For those wondering about the name CentoDieci is Italian for 110

423,UgzKKp8rSkKsS6_vIxR4AaABAg,You know how thirty years later there‚Äôs always some styling aspect we always end up laughing about on cars like these?  On this car it‚Äôs going to be those unnecessary panels with circles cut in them behind the doors and that pleating in the interior.
424,Ugzjg5TDDFhiBA2kq-R4AaABAg,"The owner has an eye for design, the team has a spirit for **creation** and Monography team got the talent to capture every bit of the both.

428,UgzASqTB1oGDfoxjbKZ4AaABAg,"The EB110 is in my opinion how Bugattis should always be made. It didn't only set the fastest top speed but it was also lightweight for what it was. It was a racing car. That's exactly why the McLaren F1 is my favorite car not only from the era but of all time. I was happy to see a tribute to one of the greatest supercars of all time, the EB110."
429,Ugy3RA2F8CkY1yhHedF4AaABAg,Congrats. It just complements the EB110 perfectly! And that should be a launch spec !!

447,UgxVyUJLZRCKzkz_7rp4AaABAg,"If I remember my Italian correctly from living in Verona, Centodieci means 100 and 10.  They had a Cinquecento car (500 cc‚Äôs) when I lived there that was so tiny, but I bet the 110 stands for something besides cc‚Äôs."
448,UgySjS4LVNxoI9cbNNB4AaABAg,just wanted to thank bugatti for letting me be the first to buy their first BUGATTI CENTODIECI

All 10 owners will pack them away in their personal auto museums and never drive them, being too valuable for such a mundane task as actually moving under their own (prodigious) power.

I may be wrong about that.  But will the world ever see one of these with 50,000 miles on it?  I think not. 

The ongoing quest for more ridiculously over-spec'ed,  and more exclusive, cars, in my opinion,  doesn't help the high end auto industry, it hurts it.   Bugatti would be smarter to build a (moderately) affordable super high performance sports car that's priced to sell in the thousands of examples,  and would likely sell out the whole planned production run in advance anyway."

1571,UgwII1EYwolKFaOOMRd4AaABAg,"What's the price?  Does it have a little back seat?  for doggie, purse, package, etc.  (Never say, if you have to ask the price then you can't afford it...Nonsense. Amounts are important to consider regardless.) ..so it is usable in general..not just for sport.  I didn't see enough of the interior.  But it looked so scrumptious..and I love the blue leather interior...the leather in this car...the patterns are so nice...looks very confortable to lean on and sit in.  Well... I need to see this more in depth and talk about it...and have a car tester drive it...like Harry's Garage,  and also Shmee and Supercar Blondie and others.  They really let the ppl feel the auto..and explain everything...that when one buys it...they are not daunted by it... but feel familiar with it.  Thank you for this creation.  I hope it has some room behind the front seats and some luggage and groceries space...I know Bugatti must be fast and nimble and balanced & road hugging.  Which is so important to me too.  I love Bugatti for decades on end.  And the old ones!!!  Any Bugatti is the one to have!!!  Brava!  Bravisima!!! The Centodieci must be quite wonderful too!!
One note... what's with the ""little"" lights in the front @0:45 ?  I don't understand it.  Looks like a differnt car...its diff3rebt wheels.  Anyway... I will look forward to a more in depth look and drive.  The back end is very pretty from the side view..very cool.  This video is not long enough."
