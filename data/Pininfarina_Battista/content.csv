0,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg,I liked how the guy on a scooter showed his appreciation of the car. Couldn't have done it better myself.
1,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9Z1ZykLxP6_,@Mike Grayrat At that price point you are paying for exclusivity. Those who buy this are on the next level and aren't thinking about how the new TSLA performs the same  or better.
2,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9Ysz4VnZ6wu,Scooter passed him. Lol
3,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9YcErpcpdFj,@Harbir Singh Just hope it‚Äôs never in an accident‚Ä¶back to the factory for a complete rebuild/re-panel‚Ä¶.if the insurance doesn‚Äôt write it off first‚Ä¶
4,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9YBSOgeETb6,"@Mike Grayrat dude you good? the tesla is literally an eletric SEDAN. and the Battista is LITERALLY a fucking supercar, the tesla is literally heavier than a fucking dolphine (im kidding dont take that seriously LOL) and the battista has a carbon exterior, a very sophisticated body, and a lot more."

6,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9XFeYCJTpeQ,@Mike Grayrat italians overprice there cars to much tesla has better for a cheaper price like tge upcoming roadster 200k pounds 0-60 in 1 second i dont know if yall have seen it.
7,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9V3qh7D4KXU,"The guy on the scooter was a dolt. He knew about as much about cars as Bozo the Clown. He was in awe of the car's aesthetic, not the implications of how foul to the Earth this car - and all other electric vehicles - are!"
8,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UTRjfH9gp0,"‚Äã@Squillium Fancyson A lot of arguments can be made against EV's; my main one is that EV fanboys are the equivalents of Mac fanboys. They've simply given up, or/and hate all that technology stands for. Meanwhile petrolheads seek the glory of teardropping exhaust notes and roaring V8's, EV fanboys wank over teleporting as the future's ultimate joy of transportation. There's no reason not to despise their skillessness and disappreciation."
9,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UOEUzy0s0x,@Squillium Fancyson over priced trash that's all I know
10,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UODP1x-idZ,@Mike Grayrat also the Tesla has panel gaps so big that you could slide through them and into the car.
11,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UOCwd7WTMd,@Mike Grayrat a Tesla can‚Äôt brake for its own battery life.
12,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UISo2ruA5s,Set up.
13,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UFr8eS8zCt,@Mike Grayrat 130k for the build quality of a toy
14,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UF-UkENtig,Of a* car. Even a Yugo is better than that scooter.
15,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9UAxCm4KNi1,Gazoline has been replaced by coal. Congratulations !
16,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TrOyJ-HMDc,"Incorrect. He was just being annoying, self serving and dangerous"
17,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TkLqE7if_9,"@Phoenix  ùôæùöôùöéùöó ùôºùö¢ PROFILE you mean a motorcycle that weighs so little and only delivers power to one wheel? You can't compare a car (which you might survive in Am 80mph crash) to dying on a notice street bike
- FORMER biker"
18,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TfxUwCLEWl,@Mike Grayrat one of those spec sheets are made up
19,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TLwR9jnCwk,@Mike Grayrat S T A T S lol. It is not only stats in the brochure what makes up a car. Ballista is over priced trash? More like S plaid's platform is trash. It can't even hope to touch Ballista on a race track.
20,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TJP-GOpnid,"He was probably Italian based on the gestures, and he just smelled the Italian design."
21,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TJL0YB7yZT,@Mike Grayrat WOW VeRy CoOl
22,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TJGK2CpExQ,"@Harbir Singh something that I really don't like. 
I will be happy when tesla roadster 2.0 comes to the market and smash all this wannabe hypercars with some real performance rather than carbon this and leather that. 
The same reason why I love viper, Camero zle, corvette c7 zr1, and  Porsche gt3. Even though porche is costly it delivers"
23,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TIcGs5uNnc,"@Mike Grayrat check out the carbon fibre on and inside that thing. Carbon fibre is expensive. Plus every single material on this thing is many times the cost of materials of a regular consumer car. That's hyper car for you. 

Also, in that market your manufacturing is not as automated as Tesla's is, which increases the cost. Not as many cars are produced, so each car needs to be much more expensive to make profit. Add to that the brand cost. Brand is what counts when you enter the ultra luxury market. 

And that's how you get a price in millions."
24,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TI_iTNKa7e,@Mike Grayrat okay mike
25,UgxafxitLHMSIyIFcg14AaABAg.9TGnAhhnhxk9TIQf3BAnHU,"Not ganna lie to u the stats are pretty much identical to the new tesla and at 131,000$ and hose 0 to 60 in 2 seconds and has 390 mile and has more room so this super car I simply don't care about its over priced trash"
26,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg,That‚Äôs officially the best looking EV I‚Äôve ever seen.
27,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9XKeXq4otcQ,"Exactly

It doesn't have the usual electric car stupid design choices like funny looking wheels or blocked air ducts lol

Why is it so important to make electric cars look different and uglier lol

Look at the electric hummer too.  Ugliest car I've ever seen with all the rounded body parts"
28,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9WXtWRBtLh0,@Oliver Smiddy this one looks better. Italian style
29,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9VBM7dKPT3N,@Ryuk used to. Pininfarina dont design Ferrari anymore. They got they own design studio but these days ones dont know. Its still Ferrari but it does not had charming as it used to be for decades.
30,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9UzHsb7W8Ok,I know taste is very individual but I'm just not seeing anything special in this car. It looks like a car from a videogame where they don't have the license for actual manufacturers so they just make their own versions.
31,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9UgmkN8CRUX,@Steven Lewis leaf is on another level üòà
32,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9Ub7Q_Mjkwy,Aspark Owl... thank me later

34,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9U75OCO0OPe,You need to see vazirani shul
35,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TzcPM00B6t,These guys design Ferraris

37,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9ToOGfEOffW,"@Steven Lewis Perhaps the best comment so far. Well done Steven, 10 out of 10 would recommend."
38,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TnAsbx5slR,You obviously haven‚Äôt seen the new Leaf?
39,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9Tm1tQoDaXf,@Ben Sykes Evija looks like koenigsegg ccx on electric steroids. It look old and weird.
40,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TggPdeNidn,"@Oliver Smiddy The Evija and the one in this vid (idk hot to spell it) are too different the Evija looks like something from the future that can hover and is also a modern sculpture, this one is more conventional, but also better looking than a lot of other super cars nowadays."
41,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TXCvX1ODx-,Pininfarina did well with this automobile. Lotus knocked it out the park with the Evija.
42,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TVbaWOddA_,"made by pininfarina, it should be good looking"
43,UgxT5qEJMpnRliPRHZh4AaABAg.9TOpeQDgPIZ9TTroc4g7zU,You need to take a look at an Evija then. They are stunning.
44,UgyGIR4g4YGrmJsPg994AaABAg,"I really miss the days when a Top Gear presenter told you about the sound it made, then actually shut their pie-hole for more than a nanosecond to let us hear it‚Ä¶."
45,UgyGIR4g4YGrmJsPg994AaABAg.9TP4pp20HCF9cRVBCV3wiZ,"Which is why I prefer Jeremy, James, and Richard over the new guys because they respect the noises the cars make and then compare it to something."

53,UgyGIR4g4YGrmJsPg994AaABAg.9TP4pp20HCF9XFf-zjosV-,Stop complaining or why are you here to see this...
54,UgyGIR4g4YGrmJsPg994AaABAg.9TP4pp20HCF9WqrzToiNTa,"Couldn't have said it better, plus, Jeremy was something else, even when he didnt shut up, people wouldnt care yk? Such an entertainer"

Yeah I remember when I tried one of those Tesla Roadsters at a car show. When it was new. And I grew up with a father that collects old american musclecars. I know what 4-5-600 hp feels like. And while you would be using both lanes, white knuckles on the steering wheel with wild, staring eyes, wondering what tree the car would inevitably wrap itself around... In the new electric car, there was ZERO drama, no event, no nothing. It just did the thing.

And I recently drove an electric BMW and  my friend came to my house to show off his new electric Mustang... Whats the difference. Same car. Same lack of motion. Same pull.

I also had my time in the games and entertainment industry in England. We did well and we drove Lamborghinis and Ferraris around for a couple of years. I had a Lotus too. And they were extremely different cars. They all had their own characteristics and personalities. All that is just dead and gone now.

And this is why traditional sportscars & supercars are shooting up in price now. Because we have heard it for years. For decades. How its the end of the traditional engine. Well now its here. We can SEE the end of it. Aston Martin, Lotus, Mercedes, many brands saying this is it. Every model from now on is electric.

But if you get rich and want to start a car collection in 5-10 years time. What will you buy? The new electric stuff? Or the good old engineering, craftsmanship, and design that went into the real thing. Its why a classic Patek Phillipe watch costs more than a mansion. Because a digital watch. or your mobile phone... can tell the time just as well. But isnt about craftsmanship and engineering."

It‚Äôs the entire experience, and a lot of that is stripped away with EVs.  Sure, they accelerate fast as hell‚Ä¶but what else?  When driving, there‚Äôs so much more to enjoy than just accelerating.  There‚Äôs shifting gears (whether standard or auto), exhaust noise, induction noise, and an overall more involved and connected driving experience."

The limiting factor is tyres now. Not power or technology. Were gonna need a whole different generation of tyres. Or wheels all together.

But have you tried that electric launch? Its unpleasant. It feels like being pulled on a steel wire behind an accelerating train. Its weird and there is almost ZERO driver engagement. No connection between driver and car. You get the senation that the car would do the same with or without you."

287,UgyE30UMo04snTdBSV94AaABAg.9THOR0mkXYh9Ul-bDSgNdR,"‚Äã@Bric Aaron You are not wrong fundamentally, however you are missing the point of my initial post by arguing semantics, it is actually about the collective identity being illogical, not about the meaning of every word individually.
This is an idiom. The same way we say that Sun rises over the mountains while actually the Earth spins over its axis and it is only our perception. 

I would like to point out few more things you did not take into account: 
- English is not the only language spoken on this planet and some things do not translate perfectly, for example when someone asks ""what is your nationality"" in American English  means from which country you are, while the nationality in this part of the world where I am from means something totally different as it takes the ethnicity to another level as Europe mostly have ethnic countries.
This creates the big difference between the civil and ethnic nationalism, while both being illogical and stupid, the former could be described as progressive while the latter is very destructive.
- There is a cultural background you did not take into account while arguing the semantics with me. In this part of the planet where I am from no one talks about the race, only ethnicity. No one sues anyone for racism, there is absolutely no talk about it. However if you look at national/ethnic conflicts you will see much more things happening. The reason people take races as something real today is again the US model, we all know why. Why the US, well because it is a super power and it leads the world today and gives an example in many ways, be it good or bad.

As I said you are missing the point, so you should evaluate your position.  If you wanted just to argue over the internet I am not interested really."
288,UgyE30UMo04snTdBSV94AaABAg.9THOR0mkXYh9Uktev1WN3D,"@Bojan Bojovic Yes, a nation could be said to be a social construct, but referring to a nation as an ""hallucination"" is flat out false. An hallucination is by definition something that does not exist. Ideologies _do_ exist, and furthermore, ideology -- that which an individual truly believes -- is the single greatest determinant for what a person is or is not willing to do. Genetic predisposition is a distant second.

Regarding race: Humans are a _species._ Within that species are various races, just like within the species of dog there are various races, which we call ""breeds"". You are engaging in hardcore Reality Denial if you actually believe that race is a ""social construct"". I find it impossible to believe that you don't understand the difference between biology and ideology. That when you look at a Samoan, an Ethiopian, a Navajo, and an Englishman you see literally no difference -- because it's all made up! It's a social construct! They're identical!

All races of Man are the same species -- we're all human beings. That means that if all races on Earth fully intermarried, within several generations there would once again be only one race. But as of now, there are many different races, and each race has its own strengths and weaknesses.

This is called Science."
289,UgyE30UMo04snTdBSV94AaABAg.9THOR0mkXYh9UkneZ5H1gX,"@Bojan Bojovic *""Nations are hallucinations.""*

Do you know where you got that false idea? A nation is not defined by geography, or even race -- a nation is defined by _ideology._ It is what a people _believe_ that sets it apart from other peoples. It is undeniable that there are very real, very stark differences between nations. To say that the difference between North Korea and England, or Mexico and the U.S.A., or Iran and Croatia is nothing more than ""hallucination"" is to engage in first-rate Reality Denial."

Especially when you say that the SF90 will need even bigger motors and batteries to make the same amount of power as if it's the only way for it to make more HP as though you havent considered other conventional ways of increasing power for an ICE car in conjunction to the hybrid powertrain? You do realise you can make an ICE supercar produce close to 2000hp by sticking big turbos and the right tuning without weighing over 2 tons right?

The first commercially sold hydrogen vehicle was in 2013, so the development has a *LOT* further to go- meaning those issues have a lot more room to improve.

BEVs mean digging materials up from the ground to power vehicles, which can never be fully recyclable...if that was a problem with fossil fuels, it's a problem with battery vehicles. Hydrogen is indeed less efficient and powerful, but power will come with development and efficiency only matters relative to electricity production- if that's clean, it's irrelevant.

We're a long way off the required development and infrastructure for hydrogen, but it is a much more sustainable technology, which is precisely the point. BEVs are bad for the environment, better than ICEs for sure, but bad- which makes the whole argument for them self defeating in the long run."

And something physically missing from the ICE cars is the torque. There is really nothing like that instant torque so if you want to get into a conversation about the driving experience physically, there's one detail that really matters. But for now, EV will be heavier until they make batteries lighter. I wonder when that day will come...and the lighter these get, the faster they get. Imagine how much room EV's have to grow considering how much room there is to improve in weight. That's somewhat scary of a thought but that'll be something."

It's true EVs are pushing the ""look how fast we can accelerate"" thing way too much though. They can have a really low centre of gravity- that was a selling point in my previous hybrid, I feel like that should be more of a thing. They're doing it, but all the publicity is about acceleration.

Sustainable ICE fuel will be expensive- great for motorsport and collectors but not viable for most people. Porsche reckon their fuel will be at least 10x the price of petrol at best. I'm hoping for hydrogen (since batteries are fundamentally pretty crap) and I'll get over the sound with a good stereo and nice luxury, but I wouldn't mind keeping my flat 6 Porsche and running it on expensive eFuels occasionally!"
327,UgxXZgN9u4FZf7O0pZB4AaABAg.9TGiVk4L7yN9TGuwJR48PK,"@Apothecary Terry it's abit of a stretch to say a current 911 sounding no better than an EV though, and that ICE cars are also going towards the same trend of EVs . Even if it's what you say, it's definitely nowhere near as bad. EVs have already started becoming 1 trick ponies and virtually identical to one another despite only just starting their legacy as the future of the automobile for mainstream adoption... I sincerely hope the R&D into synthetic fuels bears fruit such that ICE power can indeed be viable for a sustainable future. A good sign that the world hasn't given up on this pursuit would be F1, having just announced that they will work towards developing 100% sustainable fuel which could eventually have a trickle-down effect to commercial usage if it is successful."

That's almost 1000kg more than a P1 or LaFerrari, its all about power to weight, not outright power.       Electric cars power will go up hugely no doubt,  but it's  going to be more interesting to see if they get the weights down.      Gordon Murray's T50 with 986kg (2,174 lb) or maybe less in final production with 652 bhp  is a lot more exciting to me, for now than any of these electric dragsters."

Actually, the point _was_ that we didn't have enough oil, until the communists realized that we _did._ Just like the issue was Global Cooling, then it was Global Warming, now it's Climate Change. You're right -- I generally ignore issues which aren't actually an _issue._

_The entirety of North America used to be underwater._ We're not talking about a few centimeters of sea level change.

Just a short 10,000 years ago much of what is now the U.S. was covered in glaciers. And yet you let communists tell you that humanity is doomed because the climate changes just like it has always changed -- even though you have zero personal evidence for it. Even though much of what you are told about climate is outright lies, and _all_ of the predictions ever made by climate fearmongerers have been flat-out wrong. All of them.

You're told that carbon dioxide is dangerous, when it is what plants breathe. The more CO2, the bigger and faster plants/trees grow, and hence the more oxygen they produce. CO2 is literally green.

I'm not the liar telling you to trust me on this -- the liar wants you to believe him implicitly. I'm telling you to do your own research. Don't blindly listen to Doomsday fearmongerers. Trust to 1. Science, and 2. The evidence of your own senses."

518,UgxY--Jac4glum-eE814AaABAg.9TGt2n1X8F29TJBRCHSZA7,EV = appliance. Petrol forever !
519,UgxY--Jac4glum-eE814AaABAg.9TGt2n1X8F29THVENbiPkN,"@John Carlo Power to weight is a big thing- that's why I was saying it matters that it'll drop most of that weight without all the EV stuff. As a British guy whose last car also had a 2GR engine, I can't not be an Evora fan ‚ò∫ Currently I'm in a 981CS which is a little more playful than the Evora but fairly similar overall. If someone offered to swap it for a 992 Turbo S the answer is no (well, yes, but only so I can sell the 992, buy the 981CS back and keep the change!).

Power to weight also only helps acceleration (plus transmission can have an immense impact). A car can have poor power to weight and still be huge fun. Low weight is good, but low power isn't an issue- hence why a Suzuki Swift Sport is so damned fun. Once cars get over about 1500kg they need power I think, but a 1 tonne car with 100hp can be great fun.

Should also add against my original point, I'd take a 1750kg EV with 300hp too, at least once I can't have a flat 6. A smaller, cheaper, lower range car than this should be able to achieve that. My last car was 1845kg with 345hp and loads of fun, having batteries to drop that centre of gravity does great things to the balance."

My current car with 325hp is more than fast enough at 1325kg. I don't know how much an MA1.23 weighs but in this car it would probably be pretty similar overall after that swap...so yes I'd be happy with that.

Power and speed don't equate to fun either. A 180hp Fiesta ST or 150hp MX-5 is infinitely more fun than a BMW 550i for example."

Just look at the market, it speak for itself.
A ICE city car is not that expensive to maintain either  ‚Ä¶ and most of the Japanese or Korean are the most reliable, with a warranty for 7 years. 

Most of your arguments are valid if you work a 9-5 job that is not far away from you and with a private home with a garage that have a charger.
And in your free time you don‚Äôt go far than 400 miles/km 


But Where are people that live in an apartments that don‚Äôt have a garage to charge? Because you know most of the worlds population lives in a city.

Where are people that need to do 250 km/ miles some days in a week and can‚Äôt stop to charger for 20-30 minutes. Or can‚Äôt charge in the works parking lot.

Where are people that are willing to pay 2/4 of the car to replace batteries?

I hope the car makers that you invested in are 
Trying to solve those ‚Äúproblems‚Äù, and when those problem are solved I will admit that Ev cars are more practical, but right no, because they are not. Simple as that. I doubt you invested in EV company in 2000 but, who knows"
550,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9TIRMjCN8io,@Filoz P New batteries can last up to 15 years without degradation. LMFAO. By that time in an ICE you have replaced the whole engine üòÇ
551,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9TIRIkuX_LF,"@Filoz P I did. I invest in an EV start up in mid 2000s.  LMFAO. You are still screaming about batteries and range, when EVs right now have a range of more than 400 kms. More than you could need. Lmao. If you live in an apartment, where would you  park your ICE car? LMFAO. If you can park a car in an apartment, you can definitley charge it there. LMFAO. Such bs really. 

Also, doesn't ICE have maintenance too? LMFAO. You need to change its oil, you need to put petrol in it. With EVs just replace the battery there you go. In ICE if you damage your engine you might need to replace it altogether. LMFAO.  And you do realise that the electric charging network has been existing since the advent of electricity in the early 1900s. So superchargers will only proliferate.

Again, EVs are not twice the price of ICEs. You are thinking of tesla. LMFAO. They're not the only EV manufacturer. Tesla is absolutely overpriced.

You see, every car manufacturer is going electric. Because they see that ICE is ultimately dying. And it's EV where the money is. Basically not everyone is as backwards thinking as you are. LMFAO. It's so satisfying to see you being so ignorant on so many levels.

565,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THnO4IOBsG,"@Scott Wills still, my point is that you can have ICE cars that make all that HP and still be kept under 2 tons, which was something you disagreed. Also, Hennessey, SSC and Koenigsegg can make production cars with almost 2000hp twin turbos that meet the required emission standards. I think you have a lack of awareness of some heavyweights in the hypercar sector."
566,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THmiddm3a6,@Filoz P I‚Äôm sorry your wrong. My original point is that ice engines are thermally inefficient so to make 1900hp and be reliable (so not some modded special that‚Äôs rebuilt often) you need loads of cooling  (which is very heavy) and the power train would need to be substantial to take the power in the lower gears. There is a reason they don‚Äôt make 1900hp production ice cars and it‚Äôs like you said - pointless. EV‚Äôs will come down in weight massively over the next couple of years as battery density improves and manufacturers start making structural packs rather than putting batteries in a car.
567,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THmLX1XCsu,"@Scott Wills  I would add that modifying a lambo will probably make u lose ur warranty and some insurance companies will not give you insurance warranty,  but at the end depend where you live, and if you‚Äôre willing to pay more for things that other have for less."
568,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THlgpY8Jx8,@lychvy no manufacturer will sell a Modified Lamborghini equivalent they would be too unreliable and wouldn‚Äôt meet emissions standards.
569,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THlaGwPXXz,"@Scott Wills You don‚Äôt know much about car weights, if you compare the weight of an Engine to a electric engine they probably have the same weights, but the battery pack is heavier, so the electric engine plus the battery pack make electric vehicles more heavy. 


The more an electric car is powerful, the more it need battery, to have a good range of energy. 

The only good aspect about battery of electric cars, is the weight distribution, electric cars have the best central of gravity, because the batteries are in low position, a car with a ICE  will probably never reach the same result of the weight distribution as an electric vehicle. 

If you want to make a super car (right now) that is capable of going on race track ( with turns) and beat some record, it will be better with an ICE, no discussion about it. Maybe in future it will not be te case but right now yes. 

There is no way somebody can say 1500 hp and efficient in one sentence, even if it is electric, first of all because there are no public roads that you can use all of the horse power, yes autobahn but how many are there where you live? And second be real nobody really need something that is above 200hp, specifically if its electric with no sound at all."
570,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THZV60eqs5,"@Scott Wills and if I'm not limiting to just V12 cars, look at Koenigsegg, SSC and the whole lot of these hypercar manufacturers producing lightweight cars well over 1000hp."
571,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THZFpvY40L,"@Scott Wills well, you've had people mod V12 lambos with huge ass turbos to hit over 2000hp and I'm pretty sure they don't have to weigh over 2 tons. You can't use Bugatti as an example especially when it uses a quad turbo W16 engine AND especially when Bugatti cars are already understood to be heavier the standard hypercar, with all sorts of luxurious creature comforts."
572,UgxtYA8FOSjPLoPbMGZ4AaABAg.9TF6K3HnGI-9THYO2d7lvK,"@lychvy not sure, there would be a lot of cooling required and one big petrol tank for 1900 hp let alone the torque requirement of the transmission and power train. Electric vehicles are much more thermally efficient. A Bugatti Chiron for example is the same money and weighs 2 tonne and ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 1500hp adding another 400 hp would add more weight. Internal combustion is dead when it comes to supercars I‚Äôm afraid. I believe VAG are giving Bugatti away because there is no future in the company as a combustion manufacturer."

Also smaller companies will become virtual ""customisers"" or ""coach builders"" since they now make even fewer parts of the electric cars. Batteries need large manufacturing capacities that only few entities posses, and the chassis most likely needs to be outsourced with the batteries due to the way batteries are designed to fit into a specific chassis.

In terms of design, if you look back at how Pininfarina evolved Ferrari design from say the F355 era to 458, the pace of design evolution is pretty amazing. In the Manzoni era they are still deriving from the 458 and F12. I'm sorry but the Battista shows that Pininfarina still knows how to design with their signature look balancing grace and aggression."

Turn a key, jam it in gear and go.
Why in hell would you want those settings? Can't it just be a button on the steering wheel with pussy mode, sporty mode and what have you done mode?

If it were, I'd be quite concerned given how many of these devices surround you in your daily life. Just because something is ""high frequency"" does not mean it's harmful.

1827,UgwA42009UYfsdJ3p1N4AaABAg,"Great video, but i would have to say that this car isn't entirely unique, as it shares so much with the Rimac, makes it feel like a new ""special model"" McLaren, you're left wondering: ""wait, what is special and different about this one?"", and honestly, i think the Nevara looks slightly better.
Not really a fan of the stripe on the nose on the Battista, the Nevara does it a little bit sleeker in my opinion.
The new Tesla Roadster is underway and it looks pretty badass though, and would probably match the Battista in many stats, or at least come very close to it, while costing at most half of the Battista.

Its acceleration speed is probably only marginally better (like 0.2 seconds faster?) than the Tesla Plaid as well, without the added practicality of the Plaid AND being 2.2 million dollars more expensive..
It will be considerably better than the Plaid on a track, but then again, they're both not really track cars and would probably lose out to a cheaper car that _is_ made for track racing, so you'll get passed by souped up hatchbacks and the likes, which must also not feel very nice, considering your car doesn't have the racing sound and experience that a car enthusiast loves.

Not saying that i'm a Tesla fanboy, but it's getting increasingly more difficult to justify these pricetags, when the alternative is so much cheaper and more practical.
IF i had the money, and that is of course a huuuuuge IF, i would buy a handful of classics (Countach, Diablo, Viper, NSX) AND a Plaid to tune and mess around with."
1828,UgwA42009UYfsdJ3p1N4AaABAg.9TFrAgGcpoG9TH1rn1C44I,"@V6TT I know, but still, you can be like: ""oh, cool car, expensive?"", and they go: ""yeaah... 2.4 million"", i would immediately go: ""What?! How, why??"".
Like, the only reason why it's so expensive, is because they only make a couple hundred of them, like a limited edition run of sneakers, artificially high prices.

A Countach can be bought for under half a million, and of course, it's a shitty car when in slow traffic, but at least you can sorta understand the price, it's a legend and a pretty rare car, these new models start at 4 or 5 times that price and nobody remembers them.

And in my opinion these prices are just way too high anyway, they've gone way beyond the ""i'd consider it"" point.
I wouldn't buy a Lamborghini Sian for 2.6 million either, but i would rather choose the Sian over the Battista, as you wouldn't have to stop after  few laps on the track every time.

But really, none of those new super expensive cars are legends, or will become legends, well, maybe 1 or 2, but you can buy REAL legends for much less.
I think most people will have forgotten about this car in 6 months time.

If you want a fast car around the track, buy a track focused car, because there's no way you will actually be racing a multimillion dollar car to its limits around the track often.
If you want a fast car on the street, any other car will do.

Stats are nice, but who really uses the cars to the max, just like the McLarens, almost every new car they make is a multi million dollar exclusive car, it just reached a point where these numbers become arbitrary, when Tesla can get similar stats for a 10th of the price of the Pininfarina/Rimac, you kinda have to look around and think: ""guys.. what are we doing?"".

Old hypercars were expensive, but not _that_ expensive, and many of them are still under the price of current new novelty cars.
Luxury and tech improves, but still.. not a million dollars of worth, when, again, the Tesla does the tech department for a 10th of the price.
And again, i'm not saying the Battista is a bad or ugly car, i'm not in love with it, but it is a pretty car, and it has good stats, but yeah.. 2.4 million?
No, just no.
Even IF i was swimming in money.
Maybe, i'll just wait a couple of years and buy it for half or a third of the price, assuming they devalue, otherwise, screw it :P

If this car came on the market for $400.000, it would probably be much more popular as it would be within ""realistic"" reach of the people who would REALLY want one.

But yeah, that's just me of course, but really, out of all the multimillionaires, who would really desire this car, when it's stats are similar to the (in my opinion) prettier Rimac Nevera, and similar to the waaaay cheaper Plaid and upcoming Roadster.
The novelty of insta-accel can be achieved for a 10th of the price, and it has zero of the NA driving experience."
