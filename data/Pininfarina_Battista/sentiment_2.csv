Yeah I remember when I tried one of those Tesla Roadsters at a car show. When it was new. And I grew up with a father that collects old american musclecars. I know what 4-5-600 hp feels like. And while you would be using both lanes, white knuckles on the steering wheel with wild, staring eyes, wondering what tree the car would inevitably wrap itself around... In the new electric car, there was ZERO drama, no event, no nothing. It just did the thing.

And I recently drove an electric BMW and  my friend came to my house to show off his new electric Mustang... Whats the difference. Same car. Same lack of motion. Same pull.

I also had my time in the games and entertainment industry in England. We did well and we drove Lamborghinis and Ferraris around for a couple of years. I had a Lotus too. And they were extremely different cars. They all had their own characteristics and personalities. All that is just dead and gone now.

And this is why traditional sportscars & supercars are shooting up in price now. Because we have heard it for years. For decades. How its the end of the traditional engine. Well now its here. We can SEE the end of it. Aston Martin, Lotus, Mercedes, many brands saying this is it. Every model from now on is electric.

But if you get rich and want to start a car collection in 5-10 years time. What will you buy? The new electric stuff? Or the good old engineering, craftsmanship, and design that went into the real thing. Its why a classic Patek Phillipe watch costs more than a mansion.

This is an idiom. The same way we say that Sun rises over the mountains while actually the Earth spins over its axis and it is only our perception. 

I would like to point out few more things you did not take into account: 
- English is not the only language spoken on this planet and some things do not translate perfectly, for example when someone asks ""what is your nationality"" in American English  means from which country you are, while the nationality in this part of the world where I am from means something totally different as it takes the ethnicity to another level as Europe mostly have ethnic countries.
This creates the big difference between the civil and ethnic nationalism, while both being illogical and stupid, the former could be described as progressive while the latter is very destructive.
- There is a cultural background you did not take into account while arguing the semantics with me. In this part of the planet where I am from no one talks about the race, only ethnicity. No one sues anyone for racism, there is absolutely no talk about it. However if you look at national/ethnic conflicts you will see much more things happening. The reason people take races as something real today is again the US model, we all know why. Why the US, well because it is a super power and it leads the world today and gives an example in many ways, be it good or bad.

As I said you are missing the point, so you should evaluate your position.

My original point is that ice engines are thermally inefficient so to make 1900hp and be reliable (so not some modded special that‚Äôs rebuilt often) you need loads of cooling  (which is very heavy) and the power train would need to be substantial to take the power in the lower gears. There is a reason they don‚Äôt make 1900hp production ice cars and it‚Äôs like you said - pointless.

The more an electric car is powerful, the more it need battery, to have a good range of energy. 

The only good aspect about battery of electric cars, is the weight distribution, electric cars have the best central of gravity, because the batteries are in low position, a car with a ICE  will probably never reach the same result of the weight distribution as an electric vehicle. 

If you want to make a super car (right now) that is capable of going on race track ( with turns) and beat some record, it will be better with an ICE, no discussion about it. Maybe in future it will not be te case but right now yes. 

There is no way somebody can say 1500 hp and efficient in one sentence, even if it is electric, first of all because there are no public roads that you can use all of the horse power, yes autobahn but how many are there where you live?

Not really a fan of the stripe on the nose on the Battista, the Nevara does it a little bit sleeker in my opinion.
The new Tesla Roadster is underway and it looks pretty badass though, and would probably match the Battista in many stats, or at least come very close to it, while costing at most half of the Battista.

Its acceleration speed is probably only marginally better (like 0.2 seconds faster?) than the Tesla Plaid as well, without the added practicality of the Plaid AND being 2.2 million dollars more expensive..
It will be considerably better than the Plaid on a track, but then again, they're both not really track cars and would probably lose out to a cheaper car that _is_ made for track racing, so you'll get passed by souped up hatchbacks and the likes, which must also not feel very nice, considering your car doesn't have the racing sound and experience that a car enthusiast loves.

Not saying that i'm a Tesla fanboy, but it's getting increasingly more difficult to justify these pricetags, when the alternative is so much cheaper and more practical.
IF i had the money, and that is of course a huuuuuge IF, i would buy a handful of classics (Countach, Diablo, Viper, NSX) AND a Plaid to tune and mess around with.","Great video but i would have to say that this car isnt entirely unique as it shares so much with the Rimac makes it feel like a new special model McLaren youre left wondering wait what is special and different about this one and honestly i think the Nevara looks slightly better

Like, the only reason why it's so expensive, is because they only make a couple hundred of them, like a limited edition run of sneakers, artificially high prices.

A Countach can be bought for under half a million, and of course, it's a shitty car when in slow traffic, but at least you can sorta understand the price, it's a legend and a pretty rare car, these new models start at 4 or 5 times that price and nobody remembers them.

And in my opinion these prices are just way too high anyway, they've gone way beyond the ""i'd consider it"" point.
I wouldn't buy a Lamborghini Sian for 2.6 million either, but i would rather choose the Sian over the Battista, as you wouldn't have to stop after  few laps on the track every time.

But really, none of those new super expensive cars are legends, or will become legends, well, maybe 1 or 2, but you can buy REAL legends for much less.
I think most people will have forgotten about this car in 6 months time.

If you want a fast car around the track, buy a track focused car, because there's no way you will actually be racing a multimillion dollar car to its limits around the track often.
If you want a fast car on the street, any other car will do.

Stats are nice, but who really uses the cars to the max, just like the McLarens, almost every new car they make is a multi million dollar exclusive car, it just reached a point where these numbers become arbitrary, when Tesla can get similar stats for a 10th of the price of the Pininfarina/Rimac, you kinda have to look around and think: ""guys.. what are we doing?"".

Old hypercars were expensive, but not _that_ expensive, and many of them are still under the price of current new novelty cars.
Luxury and tech improves, but still.. not a million dollars of worth, when, again, the Tesla does the tech department for a 10th of the price.
And again, i'm not saying the Battista is a bad or ugly car, i'm not in love with it, but it is a pretty car, and it has good stats, but yeah.. 2.4 million?
No, just no.
Even IF i was swimming in money.
Maybe, i'll just wait a couple of years and buy it for half or a third of the price, assuming they devalue, otherwise, screw it :P

If this car came on the market for $400.000, it would probably be much more popular as it would be within ""realistic"" reach of the people who would REALLY want one.

But yeah, that's just me of course, but really, out of all the multimillionaires, who would really desire this car, when it's stats are similar to the (in my opinion) prettier Rimac Nevera, and similar to the waaaay cheaper Plaid and upcoming Roadster.
The novelty of insta-accel can be achieved for a 10th of the price, and it has zero of the NA driving experience."," I know but still you can be like oh cool car expensive and they go yeaah 24 million i would immediately go What How why
Like the only reason why its so expensive is because they only make a couple hundred of them like a limited edition run of sneakers artificially high prices

A Countach can be bought for under half a million and of course its a shitty car when in slow traffic but at least you can sorta understand the price its a legend and a pretty rare car these new models start at 4 or 5 times that price and nobody remembers them

And in my opinion these prices are just way too high anyway theyve gone way beyond the id consider it point
I wouldnt buy a Lamborghini Sian for 26 million either but i would rather choose the Sian over the Battista as you wouldnt have to stop after  few laps on the track every time

But really none of those new super expensive cars are legends or will become legends well maybe 1 or 2 but you can buy REAL legends for much less
I think most people will have forgotten about this car in 6 months time

If you want a fast car around the track buy a track focused car because theres no way you will actually be racing a multimillion dollar car to its limits around the track often
If you want a fast car on the street any other car will do

Stats are nice but who really uses the cars to the max just like the McLarens almost every new car they make is a multi million dollar exclusive car it just reached a point where these numbers become arbitrary when Tesla can get similar stats for a 10th of the price of the PininfarinaRimac you kinda have to look around and think guys what are we doing

Old hypercars were expensive but not that expensive and many of them are still under the price of current new novelty cars
Luxury and tech improves but still not a million dollars of worth when again the Tesla does the tech department for a 10th of the price
And again im not saying the Battista is a bad or ugly car im not in love with it but it is a pretty car and it has good stats but yeah 24 million
No just no
Even IF i was swimming in money
Maybe ill just wait a couple of years and buy it for half or a third of the price assuming they devalue otherwise screw it P
