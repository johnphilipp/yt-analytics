Yeah I remember when I tried one of those Tesla Roadsters at a car show. When it was new. And I grew up with a father that collects old american musclecars. I know what 4-5-600 hp feels like. And while you would be using both lanes, white knuckles on the steering wheel with wild, staring eyes, wondering what tree the car would inevitably wrap itself around... In the new electric car, there was ZERO drama, no event, no nothing. It just did the thing.

And I recently drove an electric BMW and  my friend came to my house to show off his new electric Mustang... Whats the difference. Same car. Same lack of motion. Same pull.

I also had my time in the games and entertainment industry in England. We did well and we drove Lamborghinis and Ferraris around for a couple of years. I had a Lotus too. And they were extremely different cars. They all had their own characteristics and personalities. All that is just dead and gone now.

And this is why traditional sportscars & supercars are shooting up in price now. Because we have heard it for years. For decades. How its the end of the traditional engine. Well now its here. We can SEE the end of it. Aston Martin, Lotus, Mercedes, many brands saying this is it. Every model from now on is electric.

But if you get rich and want to start a car collection in 5-10 years time. What will you buy? The new electric stuff? Or the good old engineering, craftsmanship, and design that went into the real thing. Its why a classic Patek Phillipe watch costs more than a mansion.

This is an idiom. The same way we say that Sun rises over the mountains while actually the Earth spins over its axis and it is only our perception. 

I would like to point out few more things you did not take into account: 
- English is not the only language spoken on this planet and some things do not translate perfectly, for example when someone asks ""what is your nationality"" in American English  means from which country you are, while the nationality in this part of the world where I am from means something totally different as it takes the ethnicity to another level as Europe mostly have ethnic countries.
This creates the big difference between the civil and ethnic nationalism, while both being illogical and stupid, the former could be described as progressive while the latter is very destructive.
- There is a cultural background you did not take into account while arguing the semantics with me. In this part of the planet where I am from no one talks about the race, only ethnicity. No one sues anyone for racism, there is absolutely no talk about it. However if you look at national/ethnic conflicts you will see much more things happening. The reason people take races as something real today is again the US model, we all know why. Why the US, well because it is a super power and it leads the world today and gives an example in many ways, be it good or bad.

As I said you are missing the point, so you should evaluate your position.  If you wanted just to argue over the internet I am not interested really.","‚Äã Aaron You are not wrong fundamentally however you are missing the point of my initial post by arguing semantics it is actually about the collective identity being illogical not about the meaning of every word individually

 There is a cultural background you did not take into account while arguing the semantics with me In this part of the planet where I am from no one talks about the race only ethnicity No one sues anyone for racism there is absolutely no talk about it However if you look at nationalethnic conflicts you will see much more things happening The reason people take races as something real today is again the US model we all know why Why the US well because it is a super power and it leads the world today and gives an example in many ways be it good or bad

You're told that carbon dioxide is dangerous, when it is what plants breathe. The more CO2, the bigger and faster plants/trees grow, and hence the more oxygen they produce. CO2 is literally green.

Electric cars though will *NEVER* arouse the same passion nor garner the same following as internal combustion engined cars. Electric cars are boring and very similar beneath the skin, and liking one over another is akin to liking a Dell laptop over an HP one. Also smaller companies will become virtual ""customisers"" or ""coach builders"" since they now make even fewer parts of the electric cars. Batteries need large manufacturing capacities that only few entities posses, and the chassis most likely needs to be outsourced with the batteries due to the way batteries are designed to fit into a specific chassis.

Not really a fan of the stripe on the nose on the Battista, the Nevara does it a little bit sleeker in my opinion.
The new Tesla Roadster is underway and it looks pretty badass though, and would probably match the Battista in many stats, or at least come very close to it, while costing at most half of the Battista.

Its acceleration speed is probably only marginally better (like 0.2 seconds faster?) than the Tesla Plaid as well, without the added practicality of the Plaid AND being 2.2 million dollars more expensive..
It will be considerably better than the Plaid on a track, but then again, they're both not really track cars and would probably lose out to a cheaper car that _is_ made for track racing, so you'll get passed by souped up hatchbacks and the likes, which must also not feel very nice, considering your car doesn't have the racing sound and experience that a car enthusiast loves.

Not saying that i'm a Tesla fanboy, but it's getting increasingly more difficult to justify these pricetags, when the alternative is so much cheaper and more practical.

1828,UgwA42009UYfsdJ3p1N4AaABAg.9TFrAgGcpoG9TH1rn1C44I,"@V6TT I know, but still, you can be like: ""oh, cool car, expensive?"", and they go: ""yeaah... 2.4 million"", i would immediately go: ""What?! How, why??"".
Like, the only reason why it's so expensive, is because they only make a couple hundred of them, like a limited edition run of sneakers, artificially high prices.

A Countach can be bought for under half a million, and of course, it's a shitty car when in slow traffic, but at least you can sorta understand the price, it's a legend and a pretty rare car, these new models start at 4 or 5 times that price and nobody remembers them.

And in my opinion these prices are just way too high anyway, they've gone way beyond the ""i'd consider it"" point.
I wouldn't buy a Lamborghini Sian for 2.6 million either, but i would rather choose the Sian over the Battista, as you wouldn't have to stop after  few laps on the track every time.

But really, none of those new super expensive cars are legends, or will become legends, well, maybe 1 or 2, but you can buy REAL legends for much less.
I think most people will have forgotten about this car in 6 months time.

If you want a fast car around the track, buy a track focused car, because there's no way you will actually be racing a multimillion dollar car to its limits around the track often.
If you want a fast car on the street, any other car will do.

Stats are nice, but who really uses the cars to the max, just like the McLarens, almost every new car they make is a multi million dollar exclusive car, it just reached a point where these numbers become arbitrary, when Tesla can get similar stats for a 10th of the price of the Pininfarina/Rimac, you kinda have to look around and think: ""guys.. what are we doing?"".

Old hypercars were expensive, but not _that_ expensive, and many of them are still under the price of current new novelty cars.
Luxury and tech improves, but still.. not a million dollars of worth, when, again, the Tesla does the tech department for a 10th of the price.
And again, i'm not saying the Battista is a bad or ugly car, i'm not in love with it, but it is a pretty car, and it has good stats, but yeah.. 2.4 million?
No, just no.
Even IF i was swimming in money.
Maybe, i'll just wait a couple of years and buy it for half or a third of the price, assuming they devalue, otherwise, screw it :P

If this car came on the market for $400.000, it would probably be much more popular as it would be within ""realistic"" reach of the people who would REALLY want one.

But yeah, that's just me of course, but really, out of all the multimillionaires, who would really desire this car, when it's stats are similar to the (in my opinion) prettier Rimac Nevera, and similar to the waaaay cheaper Plaid and upcoming Roadster.
The novelty of insta-accel can be achieved for a 10th of the price, and it has zero of the NA driving experience."," I know but still you can be like oh cool car expensive and they go yeaah 24 million i would immediately go What How why
